        <title>How to start designing for Web3</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Web3 is a burgeoning field, but you can’t just take Web2 designs and expect them to work in Web3. What should you keep in mind?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-go-from-designing-ux-in-web2-to-web3&quot;&gt;How to go from designing UX in Web2 to Web3&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web3 has been built by engineers, for engineers, until now. But the recent DevCon conference hosted by the Ethereum community in Bangkok, had a huge focus on user experience and that’s never happened before. Given how geeky this community has been, even talking about usability is a huge step! There’s a shift from focussing on building infrastructure to building applications on top of that now that a lot of the required infrastructure is in place. There’s a clear realisation within the community to focus on usability with the intention of attracting the mainstream population. This presents an unprecedented opportunity for designers. But transitioning hasn’t been easy and this article intends to make that part simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;firstly-understand-web3&quot;&gt;Firstly, Understand Web3&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As UX designers know, to design something effective, we need to begin by understanding as much as possible about the technology underneath. To that end, let’s begin by understanding what is different about Web3 in contrast with Web2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;different-stack&quot;&gt;Different Stack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Web2, you have companies that own the entire application stack – they own the servers, the databases, the back-end software, the payment layer and the front-end UI layer. Users go to these companies and create accounts with them and their usage information is stored on the databases owned and operated by these same companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Web3, the network is composed of a huge number of nodes and they are the equivalents of the web server in Web2. The front-end may be built by the company and the users that want to use the software can just sign-in with their wallets and begin using it. Their data is stored on the public blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of these differences is vast. Let’s consider the scenario where the application is a social media app and the company wants to start charging a certain amount for the usage of the platform. If the user cannot afford the payment, in Web2, they have no choice but to leave the platform which also means leaving behind all the data they generated and all the friends they made on the platform. In Web3, there is no such thing as locking out the user as their data is always available on the public blockchain. If one front-end provider is charging a very high price for their app, they could use another front-end provider and still have access to all their data and their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;composability&quot;&gt;Composability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Web3 is built on standards and protocols, so they’re highly composable. This means that developers can treat all data sources and all projects as if it were their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the example given above, you can imagine a developer creating a different front-end that not only gets the social media posts from one platform, but could choose to include background music from the user’s song library from an entirely different platform and create an audio-visual experience altogether. This is possible because of the composability of Web3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;permissionlessness&quot;&gt;Permissionlessness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to develop this sort of an application on Web2, I need to get API Access from the provider, let’s say for example Twitter.  To get that access, I need to firstly submit a short essay on what I intend to do with my API access (to my own account) and then agree to terms and conditions set by Twitter’s lawyers. After this, my access remains conditional, and if I built something super popular but built something Twitter didn’t agree with or maybe felt like they would want to do themselves, they can pull my API access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s none of that on Web3. Since the data is stored on a public blockchain, it will be publicly accessible for anyone to come and write programs that can use that data without asking anyone for permission to do so and without terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ownership-of-data&quot;&gt;Ownership of Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data that is typically generated by users is publicly stored, but private data is typically encrypted using the user’s public key. This means that the data can only be decrypted by the user and no one else. This puts the user’s squarely in control of their information, not any corporation. Mining this data is also impossible if it’s encrypted, so users don’t ever have to worry about being exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pseudonymity&quot;&gt;Pseudonymity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a misnomer that people think that Web3 is anonymous. It is not. Every transaction on a blockchain is signed by a wallet. So all the data is identifiable as belonging to that wallet holder. The only piece of information that one doesn’t have is who the owner of the wallet is. But if anyone ever establishes that a certain wallet belongs to a specific person for example, the immediately stop being anonymous and their data becomes transparent on chain, otherwise known as getting doxxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes this is a deliberate thing, for example if a user wants social recognition in a game, they can establish their ownership of several items they have collected in their wallet, by demonstrating their ownership of that wallet. But often, users want to remain unknown and do not want to be doxxed if they can help it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;culture&quot;&gt;Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web3 has been built by idealists, but in a very pragmatic way in order to have real-world utility. You cannot miss hearing about the “original cypher punk” values that seem to be beneath all of it. Decentralisation is not a buzz word, it is the essence of the culture. Being authentic and original are virtues in this field. Having a different viewpoint is celebrated while corporate behaviour, censorship and authoritarianism are taboos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two biggest projects in the field Bitcoin and Ethreum. Bitcoin’s founder, is unknown. And Ethereum’s founder is Vitalik Buterin, who has actively tried to build a project that doesn’t need him to be around to succeed. He is a 29 year old billionaire who wears unicorn t-shirts and lives a nomadic lifestyle travelling the world with nothing more than what he has in his backpack. I mention these things to highlight the kind of culture that permeates through this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;speed&quot;&gt;Speed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the decentralised structures, speed is often slow when compared to AWS or other such servers. This is something to keep in mind when designing systems. You have to afford for the latency as the result of actions may actually take a long time to be written to the blockchain and are not as immediate as when using equivalent systems built on Web2 standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;key-challenges-opportunities-facing-web3&quot;&gt;Key Challenges (Opportunities) Facing Web3&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Web3 to become mainstream, there are some key challenges on the user-facing side. These are also opportunities for UX designers to come in and find solutions around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-wallet&quot;&gt;The Wallet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a user wants to do anything on web3 they need a wallet. While a lot of very user-friendly wallets do exist and some even go so far as to allow Google-sign-ins to create accounts within these wallets, the purpose and usage of these wallets is not very well understood by users. This is an area that needs a lot of work as there are no direct analogies in Web2. Communicating the intricacies of public-private key cryptography is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;managing-security&quot;&gt;Managing Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the disadvantages of Web3 is that it only has one level of security. It’s the public private key pair and nothing else. It’s always the highest level of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike in Web2, where you signed in only with a login and password on an app of low importance, and with login, password and 2FA to your email service and possibly login, password, OTP and FaceID on a banking app, there are no other levels in Web3. You can see the problems that occur if users started using the same account for social apps as well as to store their money and there was only one level of security that exists for both and that got compromised, they end up loosing everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Web3 is pseudonymous, not anonymous, so if a user doxxed themselves on a social app, their social network could easily find out everything about their finances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in case a user forgets a password in Web2, they know they can go through some steps and regain access to their accounts. This is not the case in Web3 as there’s no recovery. If the user doesn’t do a good job storing their passwords, they may loose access to their account forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all challenges that need design intervention to solve as an industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;public-relations&quot;&gt;Public Relations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some regulators hate this field because they see it as a threat to their ability to control their population. Crypto has therefore long been portrayed as a scam by the mainstream media. The field has also had several grifters who perpetrated scams and those have also created very bad press. But just like the airline industry, each mishap has informed the field as to how to become better. Web3 truly has reached a level of maturity today where it can serve mainstream use cases and make the lives of end-users a lot better. But we’ll have to overcome this PR hurdle. As a designer, you can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;trends-to-keep-in-mind&quot;&gt;Trends to Keep in Mind&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some trends already taking place that you should pay attention to, and change if you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;changing-demographics&quot;&gt;Changing Demographics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Web3 was built by engineers, for engineers, it is changing today. It is attracting far more non-technically inclined people who may be considered early-adopters. So interfaces have to cater to both audiences at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While engineers may need all the details and want to exercise control over how a transaction is performed, the early adopters tend to flock towards apps that remove the complexity and offer an opinionated (fastest transaction speeds), but simple experience. Building interfaces that cater to both may be the order of the day where interfaces can reveal more complex controls on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;changing-visual-styles&quot;&gt;Changing Visual Styles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, all of Web3 was specifically looking inwards and there was a strong visual identity. Colours were saturated, there were a ton of gradients, a lot of space themes, a lot of orbs, balls and atoms and felt very cutting edge. And everything was dark themed, possibly because the audience it was catering to were mainly male developers. But things have been changing. Things have grown a lot lighter now and the visual language has become a lot more accessible to the mainstream. The copy used on the websites also seem to be plain English these days and not filled with jargon and acronyms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-in-it-for-you&quot;&gt;What’s in it for you?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all that’s been said above, if you still need a reason to get into web3, here are a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;professional-growth&quot;&gt;Professional Growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re tired of building ecommerce portals, come over to Web3 because you’ll be working on something brand new everyday. Decentralised Finance, NFT projects, decentralised social, decentralised science, etc. these are all fields within Web3 that are being discovered everyday. If you’re interested in learning new things and staying on the bleeding edge, you should definitely consider the shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;set-standards&quot;&gt;Set Standards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several aspects that haven’t been figured out as yet. If you’re anything like me, you enjoy working in the unknown and figuring out and building standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, a project called Uniswap presented a very simple interface for swapping tokens and that’s become the de-facto standard interface that is being used anywhere tokens are swapped. Or take the way Metamask did on-boarding, that’s become the standard for all wallets today. In the same way there are a ton of other aspects of Web3 that are still being figured out and you could be there contributing new ideas into the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-it-for-the-money&quot;&gt;Do it for the money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, do it because the money is good. Web3 projects typically pay very well because there aren’t a lot of designers who understand it. But that’s not all. Contributors are typically also given project tokens as part of the compensation in place of ESOPS. While some ESOPS go up by 20% if you’re lucky, tokens on the other hand can sometime go up by 20X, so in case of an upside, the values could be life-changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as AI transformed from a sci-fi concept to an everyday reality, Web3 is following a similar trajectory. We’re already seeing traditional companies like MicroStrategy transform its business by simply holding Bitcoin, growing its market value from $1.1 billion in 2020 to over $8 billion in 2021. And that’s just from using cryptocurrency as a treasury asset. You can imagine the potential when companies fully embrace Web3’s capabilities: decentralized operations, user-owned data, and transparent transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a UX designer in Web3, you’re not just designing interfaces – you’re designing the future of digital interaction. The challenges are significant, but so are the opportunities. Start small, focus on user needs, and don’t be afraid to challenge conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, every great interface began with someone asking, “Couldn’t this be simpler?” That’s your mission in Web3. The technology is ready; now it’s time to make it human.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Ultimate Guide to Hiring the Right UX Design Agency</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It doesn’t matter that the design agency has a high rating if they aren’t a good fit for your project. But how do you find the right one?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-the-right-ux-design-agency-for-your-project&quot;&gt;The Ultimate Guide to Hiring the Right UX Design Agency for your Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I used to run my UX design agency, we had a lot of clients that came to us after already having worked with another agency for the same project. Upon enquiring as to the reason for them to switch to us, we often were told some version of “The other team just didn’t get what we wanted”. The vain side of me would have been pleased, and I often was in the beginning, until I learnt that these situations weren’t only caused by mistakes made by the vendors, but also by the businesses that hired them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a business that’s interested in hiring a UX design agency, read this article to avoid paying twice for the same thing and learn to hire the right agency for your project the first time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;understanding-ux-design&quot;&gt;Understanding UX Design&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sure-fire way to hire the wrong agency is to not understand what UX design can do for you. Design, unlike art, is about solving problems. The job of a UX designer is to develop a solution to the business problem that you articulate. They translate the business objective that you set, into the form of an application that will help achieve that goal. They do this while balancing the needs of the customers against the business interests while working within limitations posed by technology and also by your company’s brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t a simple task but I hope you can see that it takes a special blend of someone that is business oriented, technically adept, artistically inclined, detail-oriented as well as sensitive to culture to do this job right. A good design agency will be a partner in helping you achieve your goals, not someone who will spit out something pretty to slap onto your website and call it a day. You on the other hand, should be figuring out the right way to engage with such a person or a team and demanding the right kind of output from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, typically people hire UX designers to do one of the following: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have an idea for solving a certain business problem with software and you want to develop a prototype in order to further refine that idea and bring it into a form that is more real than just an idea. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want to reduce the overall costs of software production by working out all the kinks and details on paper as it were, before handing it off to a developer to build out — the “measure twice and cut once” approach.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need to bring all the disparate ideas of a bunch of stakeholders from across your organisation and put it into a cohesive form of a software application.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want to build a prototype and build consensus across all the major stakeholders within your organisation before allocating budgets and building it out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want to get the product designed in order to plan out the efforts and expenses required in order to get this product built. It will also help you decide what the budget allocations need to be.
    &lt;h1 id=&quot;preparing-a-brief&quot;&gt;Preparing a Brief&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted above, it is imperative to the success of the project that you take the time to define your business objectives clearly. Try being as specific as possible, by describing things like, “We have had most of our customers purchasing items from within a single vertical, but in an ideal world, every user landing on the website would generate a cart value of $2,000 with products from across three different product verticals”, or, “Our customer service division has some of the highest churn rates and this makes it difficult to impart the brand values of our company onto new hires so that they can interact with customers in line with the way we do things here”, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless it is critical for some reason, do not make the mistake of specifying &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; this should be done too early on. For example, don’t say, you need a website, an iOS app, etc. to do these things. It’s the design team’s job is to figure out the “how” of it all. Even if they will eventually land at the point of developing a website, etc. they sometimes may surprise you by solving the problem in another way that you may not have anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the interactions that I remember fondly was with this client who was patiently listening to my team’s pitch as to the right solution to the problem he had stated previously. When one of his employees started to correct me about the mental model that I had used for designing the application, the boss, knowing fully well why he had hired us, politely interjected and asked the employee to allow me to finish. In the end, they were pleasantly surprised that we had removed an unnecessary layer while still achieving their objective. This wouldn’t have been possible if they had been hyper prescriptive about the solution they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;finding-potential-agencies&quot;&gt;Finding Potential Agencies&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the best method of finding a UX design agency is through a referral of someone that has worked with the agency because you’d also understand the fit, searching online and finding them on lists such as Clutch may be inevitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-rankings&quot;&gt;a. Rankings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that the rankings are not always completely objective. Their methods of evaluation aren’t so granular that you can reliably pass a judgement that someone ranked 20 is definitely better than someone ranked 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were ranked among the top 20 within India and 100 in the global ranking, I really would pay more attention to whether the agency is a good fit for you, which is the most important thing. Still, these lists are undeniably a great resource to rely upon while looking for design partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;b-local-vs-remote&quot;&gt;b. Local vs. Remote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design agencies can work remotely, but, I’d give the one that can come into your office a few times a greater preference score than an agency that absolutely cannot. There are specific stages, like discovery discussions, brainstorming, user testing, pitching ideas that could benefit from being done in person. So if the agency you are looking for can come into your office for these meetings specifically, it would be great, but if that’s not at all possible, it’s should not be a deal-breaker in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;c-industry-experience&quot;&gt;c. Industry Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your project has to do with improving an existing system of some kind, then industry expertise may help as you’d probably spend less time in explaining some fundamental ideas to the designers. But if you’re breaking new ground, I’d give less importance to the designers having the industry experience because most designers will learn the intricacies of the industry anyway, but also because designers that are new to a field may evaluate it with fresh eyes and see things in a different way which may be exactly what the doctor ordered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;d-alignment-of-values&quot;&gt;d. Alignment of Values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a subjective aspect to design and that’s to do with taste. Some design agencies are drawn to flash while others are drawn to quiet efficiency. Some designers may take short-cuts to solving problems quickly while others take the long but reliable paths. In all these areas, taste matters. Don’t make the mistake of hiring a designer that clearly shows you one quality in all their work and expect that they will deliver on another quality that you want. You are never going to be able to demand every little be made a certain way. Engaging an agency inherently means that you are relying on them to make several micro-decisions on your behalf. So engage wit the agency that resonates with you so that you are going to be comfortable with these choices that they will make on your behalf. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Important Side Note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Do not evaluate design portfolio’s solely based on visual design expertise, unless that’s the requirement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;filtration&quot;&gt;Filtration&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so you’ve succeeded in short-listing a few design agencies that you want to work with. Now you’ve got to figure out which one of these is the right fit for you. The filtration process should help you find someone that is technically proficient, someone that has not portrayed themselves as something more than they are, someone who fits your culture and finally fits your budget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, you could begin by requesting a proposal from each of the agencies. You can call these agencies up and have a brief discussion with them on the phone. They may request a brief from you which you can send out to them. How long they take to send out a proposal to you would itself indicate whether they have their internal processes figured out or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get the proposal, that itself becomes a good device to evaluate the capability of the agency. You see, if they are good UX designers, they would make this process easy for you right from the get go. Their proposal will clearly spell out what is involved in the process, give you firm estimates of time and costs and also detail out the payment schedules. It would have been designed to answer all the questions in your mind about engaging the agency. If it does not, this is a sign of immaturity and likely a strike against the agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post this, typically the agency may request a time slot to walk through the proposal with you. You could also request the same if they don’t offer one. In this call, make sure to cover the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you evaluate the success of your design?&lt;br /&gt;
 Design is a solution to a problem, and UX design is usually employed to solve business problems. The work that UX designers do there are not subjective but instead very clear solutions to business problems. If the design isn’t helping achieve that business goal, then the design isn’t successful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you done any work in my field? If not, what would your approach be in the design of our application?
 If they have worked in the same field, you’d be able to evaluate things on an apples-to-apples basis, but if they haven’t, you’ll understand how they’d approach learning about the field first and then solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What has been the effect of your application design? Is there data to substantiate the success?&lt;br /&gt;
 While the external design agency may not always have access to the data and analytics that emanated from their design work, this question will still let you assess whether the designer understand that their work is always based on a hypothesis and always an experiment that needs to be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What has been the biggest reasons for delays in your past projects?
 This question evaluates whether they’ve seen delays in past projects. There definitely will be a few where delays have occurred, and this is quite natural in endeavours that have a lot of interdependencies between clients and vendor teams. So the point is to probe whether they’ve understood what causes a lot of delays in projects and what steps they’ve taken to improve the process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you determined issues with your design and fixed them after the initial design was delivered?
 This goes back to the point about what designers think about their work. No matter how much research is done ahead of time, every project is based on several assumptions from the clients and from the designers, they are all based on a hypothetical understanding. The truth can only be learnt by putting the design in the hands of users and evaluated at that time. There will be things learnt that will reinforce our assumptions, but there will also be things that we will learn that could be improved. There is never a situation where everything is perfect. In reality, the designer may never have information on how things performed because the client may never share such information with external vendors. But the question is meant to probe whether designers understand the temporal nature of their work and what they do to improve their understanding and provide better solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;red-flags&quot;&gt;Red Flags&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An architect friend once mentioned this idea of inspection points. They said that if you want to examine the quality of construction of a building, you don’t need to go floor by floor and examine the beams, you can just go to the basement and look at the pillars there. If there’s any major faults in construction, the first place the weaknesses will show up will be on these pillars. In that same spirit, the following are some things that will indicate the quality of the agency that you’re working with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-acronym-overdose&quot;&gt;1. Acronym Overdose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acronyms are useful to express some ideas a little more efficiently. But it’s overuse stems from ineptitude or from a desire to hide behind them to hide a lack of knowledge. In any case, the job of a UX designer is to be understood, not to obfuscate. So if they’re not demonstrating an ability to speak to you, their potential clients, in a way that you can understand, they definitely will not be able to help you communicate any better with your end-users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-disinterest&quot;&gt;2. Disinterest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a designer to really help you succeed, it is imperative that they understand your true motivation behind working on this project. A good designer will definitely probe to find out this answer. If any of these designers haven’t bothered to do this, they will definitely not be delivering anything great for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-absolute-certainty&quot;&gt;3. Absolute Certainty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how much experience an agency has, all design work is based on a hypothetical understanding of what the problem is and the design itself is a best-guess estimate of the solution. This is because the number of variables change from project to project including end-users. So be vary of the agency that states with absolute certainty that they have the right solution. They are more likely to make mistakes than those that approach the project with humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-financial-discipline&quot;&gt;4. Financial Discipline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a designer doesn’t convey their payment schedules in their proposal, they are inexperienced and don’t have enough of an understanding of the impact of finances on the execution of a project. There have been agencies that have had to stop working on their client projects midway. This is clearly a result of the agency not understanding their processes well enough and knowing how much money they will burn while working on your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;budget-considerations&quot;&gt;Budget Considerations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you’ve not previously estimated how much you should spend for UX design, you would now have a great idea of how much it would cost based on the proposals that you would have received from the agencies that you reached out to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I understand that a lot of businesses are perplexed by the idea of paying too much for something and they want to know what the “fair market value” is. I find the idea absurd as this is not a commodity where you can substitute one designer’s output with another’s. If you find a designer whose output you like, then the “fair market value” is whatever they want to charge you then, isn’t it? But then this argument may fall on deaf ears and sound less “rational” to some, so in an effort to provide a rational answer, you could do the following exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, find out how much it would cost to employ a UX designer with about 2 years of experience on a full-time basis in your area. Divide that by 12 to get their monthly salary. Then, multiply that by 5 as a project typically requires the efforts of 4 people with varying levels of experience on a non-100% utilisation basis. That number is what you should expect to pay on a minimum (not maximum) for each month of engagement with any agency. There is no maximum that you can pay as the sky’s the limit. There are premiums you could add onto this for star designers on the teams or if the agency can bring additional skills to table, like motion design, film production, over an above the base level UX design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your company is cost conscious and wants to find a way to reduce the costs, you could try to work across geographies. Vietnam, India and Ukraine have some great English speaking UX design agencies that can provide you a lot of value for up to 40% less than what it would cost you in the US or Western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Important Side Note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The idea that you could hire four designers only for a few months and have them pull off a great output is absurd. A few of my clients at my agency have been those that have tried to do this and failed and then decided to hire an agency after all. They typically spent 1.5 to 2 times what it should have cost them in the first place, so keep that in mind.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;reviewing-agreements-and-contracts&quot;&gt;Reviewing Agreements and Contracts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite often large companies have standard boiler-plate engagement contracts for service providers, but in case you don’t you could request the engagement contract from your agency. Very often, if the proposal is detailed enough, that itself could be used to sign and formalise the engagement with the agency as it would contain all the usual terms that are covered in legal contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are very few “gotcha’s” to look out for, here are some key clauses that you want to examine before you sign the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-scope&quot;&gt;1. Scope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please make sure that all that you intend to cover in this project is covered in the scope section. Despite any conversations that you may have had, the engagement will only be decided based on what’s covered in the scope section.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-delivery-formats&quot;&gt;2. Delivery Formats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For UX design, the output is typically required by development teams, so make sure that they are receiving the following to make sure that your &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-fixed-costs&quot;&gt;3. Fixed Costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please make sure that you are working with the agency on a fixed-cost basis. They may ask you to pay on an hourly-basis for additional work, but whatever is covered within the scope should be delivered within the costs specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-ownership-of-intellectual-property&quot;&gt;4. Ownership of Intellectual Property&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most agencies will be on a “work-for-hire” contract basis, be sure to clarify that all intellectual property developed through this project will belong to your company. This will help you use the output of the project to your benefit and further development in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-non-disclosure-agreement&quot;&gt;5. Non-Disclosure Agreement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be several things that you discuss about your business in order for the agency to design their application. Make sure that the agency cannot disclose this information about your organisation without your permission. Having this agreement in place will also allow your team members to speak openly and freely with the designers allowing them to develop applications that more accurately serve your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-support&quot;&gt;6. Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every design agency will need to provide support post the delivery of their work. Documentation will only go so far and some live support will be required once in a while to explain some intricacies of the design. Make sure that the contract includes a support period post delivery and also a method to seek support well after that as that is required sometimes. Get this for remote support as well as for in-person support if that’s an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;freelancers-vs-agencies&quot;&gt;Freelancers vs. Agencies&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must speak a little about hiring freelancers as that’s often an alternative that’s considered by businesses often. As I’ve been a freelancer before building an agency, I think I am in a good position to answer this and also argue for one over the other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my considered opinion that businesses should only hire freelancers in very specific situations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The project is very cost sensitive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The project is a one-off and does not have long term impact&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You already have done enough research to guide the designer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are okay with delays&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are comfortable with the skills that are being provided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all other situations, there is absolutely no reason to hire freelancers, because with a freelancer, you get the wisdom of just one person. Design requires a lot of debate, and that’s hard to achieve as an individual, not impossible, but hard. Their learnings may also be limited as they typically are employed only on small and short term projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen cases where the freelancers don’t show up to meetings, they have ended projects without notice, or have behaved in unprofessional ways. Clients have thereafter had to find ways to scramble and recover from these setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for these reasons, I suggest working with teams where these problems are usually not prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine sells bicycles and I went to him when I wanted to get into the sport. When I asked him to recommend a bike, he showed me something that was well over the amount that I had anticipated paying for a bike. So I said that since I was just getting into riding bikes, I wanted to get one that wasn’t so expensive and then if I like the sport, I would buy something more expensive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he said in response remains with me till today because it is extremely relevant to my field. He said that if I was serious about getting into the field, I should be getting the best bike I can afford, because buying the wrong bike will actually make me hate the sport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I relate this story because it’s a great metaphor for choosing the right agency. If you make the wrong choice of agency and develop the wrong app based on their work, you may end up attributing the failure of the app to the weakness of the idea behind it. You may even end up making the wrong business decision whereas you may have come to a very different conclusion if you had just made a better decision while choosing the right agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I hope this article is useful to you in making the right choice. But if you need any help, do reach out to me once you’ve shortlisted your agencies, and I’d be happy to help you make the final choice!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Design Proposals that Boost Conversion Rates</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building proposal templates takes a lot of effort and you’re still left unsure of whether you’ve done it right. This article tries to help you fix that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;creating-a-winning-ux-design-proposal-a-comprehensive-guide&quot;&gt;Creating a Winning UX Design Proposal: A Comprehensive Guide&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crafting a UX design proposal can be challenging, but it is also an invaluable tool in securing new projects and demonstrating professionalism. A well-structured proposal not only showcases your understanding of the client’s needs but also reflects your agency’s strengths and your ability to foresee potential project challenges. Based on my years running a UX design agency, here’s a guide to creating a compelling proposal that can boost your conversion rates and help you stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-understanding-the-purpose-of-a-proposal&quot;&gt;1. Understanding the Purpose of a Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proposal is essentially the answer to the client’s questions before they commit to hiring you. They want to know if you understand their project, if you’re aligned on goals, and if your capabilities and deliverables match their expectations. Answering these questions clearly within your proposal gives clients the confidence they need to move forward with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-key-components-of-a-ux-proposal&quot;&gt;2. Key Components of a UX Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make your proposal thorough and professional, include these eight essential components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-summary&quot;&gt;Project Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary should ensure everyone is on the same page. Here, outline the specific project objectives, emphasising the agreed-upon approach. If your agency has unique strengths, such as a technical or development background, this is the place to highlight them. This section serves as a commitment to the client, defining exactly what you’ll focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feature-list&quot;&gt;Feature List&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most time-intensive sections, the feature list outlines the project at a high level, covering major elements without getting overly technical. For instance, if the project includes user authentication, mention this as a feature but avoid specific technical details like whether it will include OTP verification. This list demonstrates thorough planning, showing that you’re not just sending a generic proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scope-of-work&quot;&gt;Scope of Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline all the deliverables you’ll provide. This section can also serve as a showcase for your agency’s full capabilities, even if some services aren’t part of this specific project. For example, list everything from wireframing to prototyping, and clarify which tools and formats you’ll use. Ensuring clarity on deliverables avoids confusion later on and establishes a sense of professionalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;team-structure&quot;&gt;Team Structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explain who will be working on the project, their roles, and their experience levels. This can include a project manager, UX/UI designers, and other support roles like content creators or icon designers. Detailing your team structure justifies your pricing, showing the client that the work involves skilled professionals rather than being handled solely by a generalist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engagement-guidelines&quot;&gt;Engagement Guidelines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set out expectations on both sides. Define a single point of contact (Spock) on your team and request the same on the client’s end to streamline communication. Specify a regular meeting cadence, like weekly check-ins, to keep the project on track. This section also covers managing scope changes and clarifies your availability to avoid client requests at odd hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;support&quot;&gt;Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support goes beyond project completion, as clients may need assistance once the design phase is over. Typically, offer 30 days of support post-handover to handle clarifications and minor adjustments, but make it clear that extensive support beyond this window will incur additional charges. This also includes defining the method of support, whether remote or on-site, with associated travel costs if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cost-and-packages&quot;&gt;Cost and Packages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costing can be a make-or-break aspect of your proposal. Offering tiered packages—bare minimum, standard, and premium—can appeal to different budgets and give clients flexibility. Using a worksheet to customise package features and pricing quickly allows you to respond to client requests efficiently, showing professionalism and organisational readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;payment-schedule-and-protection-clauses&quot;&gt;Payment Schedule and Protection Clauses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing a payment schedule is essential for cash flow and client commitment. A common approach is 50% upfront, 25% midway, and the remaining 25% upon completion. Clearly state conditions for payment delays, such as the right to halt or terminate the project if payments are not made on time. Including protection clauses safeguards your interests, and clients typically view them as standard business practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;additional-annexures&quot;&gt;Additional Annexures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, append any extra information that can strengthen your proposal, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: Highlight your agency’s expertise and how you stand out. Large clients, especially, may appreciate a quick reference on your background without needing to research separately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Client Portfolio&lt;/strong&gt;: Showcasing similar past projects builds credibility. If your client seeks an e-commerce solution, for example, list other e-commerce projects you’ve completed to demonstrate your experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Bios (Optional)&lt;/strong&gt;: If certain team members have notable expertise, add brief bios. This personal touch can reinforce the unique value you bring to the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-recognising-common-proposal-traps&quot;&gt;3. Recognising Common Proposal Traps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all proposal requests are genuine. Some clients may seek proposals simply to benchmark costs, fulfil internal bidding quotas, or collect ideas without intending to hire. Though you can’t always avoid such situations, by treating ideas as renewable and presenting your unique perspective, you position yourself as a resourceful, innovative partner for potential clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-automating-for-efficiency-to-an-extent&quot;&gt;4. Automating for Efficiency (to an Extent)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automating repetitive proposal elements, like feature lists or pricing structures, can streamline your process. However, automation shouldn’t replace human interaction altogether. Proposals play a vital role in assessing potential clients and understanding their unique needs, so a fully automated system risks undermining this relationship-building opportunity. I chose to keep personal contact integral to my process, which allowed me to enjoy a diverse range of projects with clients I valued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-crafted UX design proposal is more than a sales document; it’s an opportunity to build trust and set clear expectations with clients. By including comprehensive components, adapting to different client needs, and presenting a strong sense of your agency’s capabilities, your proposal can serve as a valuable tool for both winning projects and ensuring smooth collaboration throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this framework, I hope you’ll find the proposal process smoother, more efficient, and ultimately more successful.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Designing Web3 Wallets for Mainstream Users</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a problem with Web3 wallets, they’re just too complex. But where’s the problem stemming from and how do we solve it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;web3-wallets-for-mainstream-users&quot;&gt;Web3 Wallets for Mainstream Users&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web3, the next phase of the internet powered by blockchain technology, promises to revolutionise industries, but its complexity continues to alienate mainstream users. At the heart of this challenge is the Web3 wallet—a fundamental tool required for engaging with decentralised applications (dApps), managing cryptocurrencies, and accessing blockchain networks. While Web3 enthusiasts have embraced the wallet system, its cryptographic foundations and technical jargon have left everyday users overwhelmed and frustrated. To drive mainstream adoption of Web3, we need to focus on fixing the wallet experience, making it intuitive and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we’ll explore why the wallet is the crux of Web3 usability challenges and how a thoughtful redesign grounded in familiar concepts, like banking, can unlock its full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-wallet-conundrum-complexity-meets-confusion&quot;&gt;The Wallet Conundrum: Complexity Meets Confusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary function of a Web3 wallet is to store a user’s private and public keys. These cryptographic keys are used to authorise transactions and prove the user’s identity within the blockchain ecosystem. But this process, while secure and revolutionary, is incredibly foreign to non-technical users. Terms like “private key,” “public key,” and “signing messages” can cause even the most tech-savvy Web2 users to shy away. The need for simplification is apparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Web2, users can easily send and receive money through banks or payment apps without ever having to understand the mechanics behind these systems. Web3, by contrast, demands users grasp cryptographic principles or risk losing access to their digital assets. The complexity isn’t just a barrier; it’s a deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many existing wallets, such as Zerion or Rabby, have attempted to ease the user experience by iterating on older designs. And while they have indeed made Web3 more user-friendly, they still fall short of the mainstream appeal necessary for broad adoption. These wallets are excellent by Web3 standards, but they remain inscrutable for the average Web2 user, leaving us to ask: Why can’t a Web3 wallet be as intuitive as the apps we’re already accustomed to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;terminology-matters-the-language-of-web3&quot;&gt;Terminology Matters: The Language of Web3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant part of the problem lies in the terminology itself. In Web3, terms like “wallet” are used inaccurately. In traditional banking, a wallet implies a place where you store something—cash, cards, and other financial instruments. However, in Web3, a wallet doesn’t “store” money in the traditional sense. Instead, it acts more like an access card to funds stored on the blockchain. Misleading terminology adds to the confusion, making it harder for users to understand how to manage their digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source development, which is central to the Web3 ecosystem, has contributed to this confusion. Over time, various developers have used different terms to describe the same concepts, leading to inconsistent vocabulary across platforms. For instance, “public key,” “wallet address,” and “externally owned account” all refer to the same thing, but new users won’t know that. This inconsistency hinders their ability to trust and navigate the system confidently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language is powerful, and when users encounter familiar terms, they can better grasp unfamiliar concepts. Web2 sites like e-commerce platforms utilise relatable language (“add to cart,” “checkout”) that immediately makes sense to users. The same approach needs to be applied to Web3 wallets if we want to make them accessible to the average person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-familiarity-banking-as-a-metaphor&quot;&gt;Building Familiarity: Banking as a Metaphor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve the wallet problem, we need to rethink the entire framework. Instead of framing wallets with cryptographic jargon, we should use a metaphor that resonates with mainstream users. And what’s more familiar than banking? Banking is a 2,000-year-old institution, and most people are already acquainted with its core concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By reimagining the Web3 wallet as a piece of “banking software,” we can translate complex blockchain concepts into terms users already understand. For instance, the wallet itself could be referred to as “banking software,” the wallet address as an “account number,” the private key as a “signature,” blockchain networks as “networks,” and the various fees associated with a transaction such as “tip”, “gas” and such could be simplified into “transaction fees,” just as people are used to paying on traditional payment platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This banking analogy would not only make Web3 wallets more relatable but also help ease users into the system without overwhelming them with technical details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-three-account-structure-enhancing-security-and-usability&quot;&gt;A Three-Account Structure: Enhancing Security and Usability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to simplifying the terminology, a redesigned Web3 wallet should also mimic the structure of traditional banking. A banking app typically offers various types of accounts—checking, savings, and investment—and the same can be applied to Web3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checking Account&lt;/strong&gt;: This would be where users conduct everyday transactions with known entities or individuals, similar to a checking account in traditional banking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savings Account&lt;/strong&gt;: This would serve as a secure place to store assets, where users could stake cryptocurrencies or simply keep them safe. It would allow users to generate interest on their holdings without needing to interact with external applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment Account&lt;/strong&gt;: For users seeking higher risk and reward opportunities, this account would enable interaction with decentralised applications (dApps) for staking, lending, or other investment activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This compartmentalisation not only makes the system more intuitive but also enhances security. By limiting the interactions of the checking and savings accounts with external applications, users can reduce their exposure to potential security risks. Only the investment account, which is meant for higher-risk activities, would be open to external dApps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-road-ahead-evolving-web3-for-the-mainstream&quot;&gt;The Road Ahead: Evolving Web3 for the Mainstream&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the wallet is the linchpin of Web3 adoption. If we can make the wallet experience seamless and intuitive, we can unlock Web3’s immense potential for a wider audience. The key lies in rethinking both the terminology and structure, using familiar banking concepts to demystify the process. By addressing these foundational issues, we can bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, paving the way for mass adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For designers and developers working on Web3 applications, this means prioritising usability over technical prowess. It means considering what mainstream users already know and building upon that knowledge, rather than introducing new, foreign concepts. The future of Web3 is bright, but only if we can make it accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five personal AI assistant devices reviewed and what they need to fix</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The world of AI assistants has taken a sharp leap forward with new devices emerging every year. However, despite the excitement around these personal AI assistant devices, many haven’t lived up to their full potential. Having headed a UX design agency ranked among the top 100 globally, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges and nuances of designing new tech. Today, I want to share with you seven critical mistakes these products are making—and how I believe we can fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-arent-personal-ai-assistants-taking-off&quot;&gt;Why Aren’t Personal AI Assistants Taking Off?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the nitty-gritty, let’s get one thing clear. The personal AI assistants I’m referring to aren’t like Siri or Google Assistant on your phone. We’re talking about devices that can break down complex tasks and execute them for you—whether it’s running apps, searching the web, or even coding in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These devices are mostly aimed at early adopters right now, but the goal is to create something for everyone. If you picture the product adoption lifecycle, we’re still in the early adopter phase. Right now, companies are testing their products in different niches, trying to figure out what sticks. It’s a chaotic phase, and we’re seeing an explosion of ideas—some good, some not so much. A lot of these ideas won’t make it to the mainstream, but that’s what makes this phase so exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s dig into the seven mistakes these AI assistant products are making and how I think they can course-correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-not-using-the-right-metaphor&quot;&gt;1. Not Using the Right Metaphor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first mistake is starting with the wrong metaphor. Products need to fit into a framework that users already understand. People don’t like adopting something completely alien. I always say evolution trumps revolution, especially in mass-market products. Finding a metaphor that connects the new with the familiar is crucial. AI assistants should be positioned as an evolution of tools people already know, not a radical shift that alienates potential users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-limited-accessibility-and-reachability&quot;&gt;2. Limited Accessibility and Reachability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an AI assistant to succeed, it needs to be extremely accessible. Think about the evolution of computing—from desktops to laptops, tablets, smartphones, and now wearables. The goal is to bring tech closer to the user. Personal AI devices need to occupy that space between a smartphone and the user—something wearable that’s always available at a moment’s notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users are going to need to learn a new behaviour—one where they think in terms of goals, not apps. The easier we make it for them to access the assistant, the quicker they’ll adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-lack-of-multimodal-inputs-and-outputs&quot;&gt;3. Lack of Multimodal Inputs and Outputs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest—audio alone isn’t enough. Yes, voice commands are intuitive and efficient for certain tasks, but information needs to be delivered in various ways. Visual feedback, like images and text, allows users to process information faster. Devices that rely only on voice, like some AI pins or pendants, miss out on the efficiency that visual data provides. The solution is to design devices with both visual and auditory outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-poor-data-privacy-protections&quot;&gt;4. Poor Data Privacy Protections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With AI, the question of privacy becomes even more critical. These devices will have access to mountains of personal data, and without strong privacy protections, they could easily become surveillance tools. The safest way to ensure privacy? Keep the data on the device itself. I think open-source projects like Open Interpreter, which runs locally on the user’s device, are on the right track. This model protects privacy and offers immediate feedback—something that cloud-based models struggle with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-lag-in-response-time&quot;&gt;5. Lag in Response Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For AI assistants to feel natural, they need to respond quickly. Research shows that interactions that take longer than 400 milliseconds feel slow and clunky. Devices relying on cloud-based AI models are always going to have some lag, no matter how fast the server is. To hit that magical threshold of 400 milliseconds, AI models need to run locally on the device. Otherwise, users will experience delays that break the flow of interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-lack-of-interoperability&quot;&gt;6. Lack of Interoperability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re transitioning to a new kind of computing—one where AI agents handle tasks for us. These agents need to be able to interact seamlessly with existing systems and applications. If a user wants their AI assistant to book an Uber or play a song on Spotify, the interaction needs to be flawless. Devices that struggle with this will quickly fall out of favour. The future belongs to AI assistants that can bridge both the current and future computing models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-failure-to-create-universal-interfaces&quot;&gt;7. Failure to Create Universal Interfaces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final mistake I see is the lack of universal, adaptable interfaces. Every request a user makes might require a different interface—one that adapts in real-time. If I ask my AI assistant to book an Uber, the interface might display a map. If I want to pick between two songs, I’ll need a list. These interfaces need to be generated on the fly, based on the user’s specific request. A rigid interface simply won’t cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-of-ai-assistants&quot;&gt;The Future of AI Assistants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the best form factor for personal AI assistants is a wearable device—specifically a smartwatch. It’s close to the user, easy to access, and can incorporate the necessary screen for visual feedback. While today’s smartwatches may not have the power to run advanced AI models, the tech is catching up. With chip technology becoming more efficient and AI models getting smaller, we’re not far from a future where AI-powered smartwatches will be the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, while none of the current products on the market have quite nailed it yet, some are closer than others. But in the end, it’s the big players—Google, Microsoft, and Meta—that are best positioned to dominate the personal AI assistant space. They have the data, and in AI, data is king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I root for the underdog, I wouldn’t bet my money on any of the current startups trying to break into this space. The race will be won by those with the resources to gather and process the vast amounts of data required to create truly effective AI assistants.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Designing a better feature request system</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If we get feedback and feature requests from users regarding products we’ve built, we get valuable insights into understanding what the users want. This is a great place to involve LLMs to handle the issues involved in this process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feedback system will do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It will allow users to submit their feature requests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To handle the problem of faster horses, it will produce a page where users can vote on things they didn’t think of before&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It will show a priority list to product teams that will allow them to understand what to develop next&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The same idea can be ported to handling bugs, but it needs to be a separate system altogether&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>DIY: A Raspberry Pi based Time Capsule</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I built an efficient Apple Time Capsule clone that will perform the task of allowing any externally connected hard drive to be used as a backup destination using the Time Machine setup on your Mac.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-this-is&quot;&gt;What this is&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to build your own Apple Time Capsule clone using the Raspberry Pi and an external hard drive, this is the slimmest and most efficient solution that you could build in under an hour, without the bonus 3D printing bit in the end of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also be successful if you just follow the steps below, but there’s a step where you need to find your Raspberry Pi on your network and reserve a specific IP address in your router which I won’t be going into that may require some prior knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-unique-about-this-solution&quot;&gt;What’s unique about this solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution has the following characteristics that make it different from other solutions that you may have seen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t need any other software such as Open Media Vault, which is great if you want to do a whole bunch of other things, but is too much of an overhead if all you want to do is build a network backup solution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This could be setup on very low horse-powered boards like the Raspberry Pi 3A+ as it runs with the services built into the OS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This solution works with more than one Mac on your network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can do this for guest logins on a network and doesn’t require an account to be setup on the Pi, so this makes it easy to use for a home environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;requirements&quot;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need the following as a minimum:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ with compatible power supply&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Micro SD Card with 4GB or more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;External hard drive of any capacity that is compatible with the Raspberry Pi’s USB port&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The drive will work with most laptops using different OS’s in case that’s needed at any time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi Imager software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;software-setup&quot;&gt;Software Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-create-the-sd-card-image&quot;&gt;Step 1: Create the SD card image&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this, simply do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1&lt;/strong&gt; Download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi Imager&lt;/a&gt; software and open the file and follow the instructions to install the software on your Mac as you would any other software
   &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-9.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.2&lt;/strong&gt; Plug in the Micro SD card into your Mac. It doesn’t matter if it isn’t already formatted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.3&lt;/strong&gt; Choose the Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) image to write to the Micro SD card
   &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1.4&lt;/strong&gt; Choose the Micro SD card that you just inserted into your Mac as the storage destination and click ‘Next’
   &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1.5&lt;/strong&gt; In the next step of OS customisation, make sure to Edit Settings and in the first tab
   &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-5.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.5.1&lt;/strong&gt; Setup the host name – this is the name of your Pi on the network. I’ve called mine “pinstripes”, but you could just call it “timecapsule” or anything else you’d like
   &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-6.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.5.2&lt;/strong&gt; User name and password for the machine. I suggest you set it to the default username and password for now which are ‘pi’ and ‘raspberry’. You can change this later if you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.5.3&lt;/strong&gt; Provide the SSID and password to enable it to connect to your Wifi network. You don’t need this if you’re using a different Raspberry Pi that connects using a LAN cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.5.4&lt;/strong&gt; On the second tab called “Services”, make sure that you enable SSH and use the password authentication mechanism. This will allow you to remotely log into your Pi with the user name and password that you setup in the previous step.
   &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-7.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.5.5&lt;/strong&gt; Hit “Save” and in the next screen click “Yes” and then “Next” to begin the imaging step. You may need to type in your login and password for your computer to tell your computer that you authorise this action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In about 15 minutes your Micro SD card is going to be ready. Just eject your card if not already done before pulling it out of your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-initialise-your-pi-and-set-it-up-on-your-network&quot;&gt;Step 2: Initialise your Pi and set it up on your network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1&lt;/strong&gt; Setup the host name – this is the name of your Pi on the network, so you could just call it “timecapsule” for simplicity or name it anything else you’d likePlug in your Micro SD card into your Pi and then plug in the power cable to the Pi. After about 5 minutes, the Pi would have booted up and then connected to your network over Wifi (or LAN in case that’s how you’d connected). You don’t need to plug in your external hard drive to the Pi as yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.2&lt;/strong&gt;  Open up a Terminal window on a laptop on the network and type in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ping timecapsule.local&lt;/code&gt;. Replace “timecapsule” with whatever you named your Pi in Step 1.5.1. This should return the IP address of your Pi on the network.
   &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-10.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.3&lt;/strong&gt;  Now type in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;arp -a&lt;/code&gt; and get the MAC addresses of all the devices connected to your network. Look for the Pi’s MAC address that corresponds to its IP address you found in the previous step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.4&lt;/strong&gt; Now log into your router which assigns the IP addresses on your network and setup a fixed IP address for your Raspberry Pi’s MAC address. This whole thing may work without this address reservation, but I’ve never tested it. So if you absolutely cannot perform this step, just go through the rest and let me know if it works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.5&lt;/strong&gt; If you’ve reserved a specific IP address for your Pi and it is different from the one it is currently assigned, you will need to reboot your Pi by turning off the power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.6&lt;/strong&gt; Once your Pi comes back on your network, go back to your Terminal window and type in the following to log into your Pi through SSH - &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh pi@192.168.0.10&lt;/code&gt; where ‘pi’ is the user name and the IP address is the one that you reserved for your Pi in step 2.4. If everything is setup properly, your Pi will ask you for a password and you could just type in ‘raspberry’ or whatever else you set up in Step 1.5.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3-prepare-your-external-hard-drive&quot;&gt;Step 3: Prepare your external hard drive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1&lt;/strong&gt; Get your external drive. Be sure you’re using a hard drive that doesn’t have any data that you want to retain as it will be lost forever once you’re done with this step. Connect the hard drive to your Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.2&lt;/strong&gt; Use “Disk Utility” to Erase and initialise your external drive. Name the drive anything you’d like such as “TimeCapsule” but make sure to use “Exfat” and if asked, the “GUID” options for maximum compatibility of the drive across different OS’s. 
&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-11.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-12.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.3&lt;/strong&gt; Once the process is complete, eject your drive from your laptop. It is ready for plugging into your Pi in the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4-get-the-software-setup&quot;&gt;Step 4: Get the software setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.1&lt;/strong&gt; While connected to your Pi through a Terminal window, do the following to update your Pi’s OS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-13.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
5
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1. `sudo apt update`
2. `sudo apt upgrade`
3. `sudo apt install exfat-fuse -y`
4. `sudo apt install samba -y
5. `sudo apt install avahi-daemon -y`
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2&lt;/strong&gt; Once the above packages are installed, let’s mount the external drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2.1&lt;/strong&gt; Plug in your external drive into the Pi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2.2&lt;/strong&gt; Type in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo df -Th&lt;/code&gt; which will list all the drives connected to the Pi. Find the identifier for your drive which should most likely be “sda2” but could be different too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2.3&lt;/strong&gt; Create a mount point by typing in the following commands &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo mkdir /mnt/timecapsule&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo mount -t exfat /dev/sda2 /mnt/timecapsule&lt;/code&gt;. Just substitute “sda2” with whatever the drive’s identifier actually is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2.4&lt;/strong&gt; Type in the following to find the UUID of your drive &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lsblk -f&lt;/code&gt; and all the drives connected to your Pi will show up (including the Micro SD card). Look for the UUID of the drive with the label ‘TimeCapsule’ if that’s what you named the drive in Step 3.2. Cross verify against the size of the drive to be sure. Copy the UUID into the clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2.5&lt;/strong&gt; To make the mount point persist across reboots of the Pi, you will need to add the following code to the file named “fstab”. You can do that by: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo nano /etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2.6&lt;/strong&gt; Paste the following in the end of the file  &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UUID=your-uuid /mnt/timecapsule exfat defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=000 0 0&lt;/code&gt; but replace the UUID with the one you copied to the clipboard in the previous step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2.7&lt;/strong&gt; Press Ctrl-X to save the file, Yes to write the buffer to file and enter to rewrite the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.3&lt;/strong&gt; Now write the configuration file to Samba, which is the file networking service that shows the drive on a network in a form that is compatible with Macs and Windows. To do this, you need to write the following code into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;smb.conf&lt;/code&gt; file by typing in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf&lt;/code&gt; which should bring up the existing configurations in the file. Press the page down key on your keyboard to get to the end of the page and paste this and make sure the mount points are correct:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.4&lt;/strong&gt; Save the file as the other files in step 2.5.3 and then restart the service with the new configurations by typing in the command into your command prompt in the Terminal &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo systemctl restart smbd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.5&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve got to do the same for the avahi service configuration. To edit the file, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo nano /etc/avahi/services/samba.service&lt;/code&gt; and paste the following code. There are no changes needed to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.6&lt;/strong&gt; Save the file as in step 2.5.3 and then restart the service by typing in the following command &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo systemctl restart avahi-daemon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest restarting the device itself to make sure that it works even if it ends up restarting on it’s own in the future. To do this, type in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo reboot now&lt;/code&gt; into your Terminal command prompt. This will disconnect your session and restart the Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, you’re ready to go and setup the Time Machine backup from your Mac as always!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;troubleshooting&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for any reason you don’t see the newly setup drive when you are setting up Time Machine on your Mac, try to connect to the drive first on the network by going to the Finder &amp;gt; Go &amp;gt; Connect to Server and then typing in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;smb://192.168.0.25&lt;/code&gt; replacing this with the IP address of your newly setup Time Capsule. You should be able to connect to the Raspberry Pi drive. Post that the Time Machine should automatically find the drive on the network. If for any reason this still doesn’t work, there’s probably some step above that you’ve missed. So give that a shot again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-step&quot;&gt;Bonus Step&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a case for the Raspberry Pi and the hard drive to be situated together. I’m designing something for this purpose and should have a 3D printable file posted here soon. Check back in a bit. But if you’d like to print something else, look at the plethora of stuff that’s available to you on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.printables.com/search/models?q=raspberry%20pi%203a+&amp;amp;ctx=models&quot;&gt;Printables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where the puck is going to be</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Product design requires you to imagine the future version of a product, but how do you do it reliably? Ice Hockey may offer some insights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;ice-hockey-and-product-design&quot;&gt;Ice Hockey and Product Design&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Wayne Gretsky quote that goes, “I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it is”, the way to win is to accurately anticipate the future outcomes as accurately as possible. The principle could be applied to product design too. The way to design a successful product is to know what the next version of the product is going to be. But the challenge of knowing what that is as challenging as judging where the hockey puck is going to be on the ice rink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while no one can be absolutely certain where exactly the puck is going to be on the rink at any given point in time, one thing everyone can be absolutely certain about is that the puck is headed towards the other team’s goal. In a similar way the product’s end goal is to suit the needs of the consumer perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consumer is human. The form the product must then take is to suit the form of a human body. If the product is meant to be held, it must fit the hand perfectly. If it is meant to be worn on the ear, then it must fit various ear types. If it is meant to be used over a period of time, then it must use materials that will not strain the user during that period. In terms of the function it performs, it must serve the needs of the human as accurately while also needing as little effort as possible. The final version of the product therefore is possible to define, at least in the abstract. If it’s not a physical product, the final form is one that serves the needs of the user perfectly and is extremely simple to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate the idea with some examples. Consider the evolution of the USB cable. Type A USB cables required the user guess which way should be facing up before plugging it into a socket. Many users struggled with this and the act of plugging in the USB A cable into a socket was a hit or a miss &lt;em&gt;every time&lt;/em&gt;. Making the cable pluggable into a socket in either orientation therefore was obvious. Therefore that’s what happened in the future iteration of the USB C cable. 
&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/USBCables.png&quot; /&gt;
Another issue with the cable was that the sockets it plugged into on the other side was variable. There were the USB A plug, USB B plug, a mini USB plug and even a micro USB plug. You therefore had to have at least one cable of each type in order to be able to connect with various device types that one bought over time, not to mention the proprietary cables that were required by some devices like smart watches. Intuitively one can see that these were too many cables to basically perform the same task. Again, no wonder the USB C cable’s invention. As of the time of writing this article, the USB C cable too has various types, the ones that supply current and the ones that also transfer data. How long do you think that’s going to stay that way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same principle can be applied to Generative AI tools – do you think specialised prompts are going to be required much longer; computer keyboards – are they more convenient than speech;  or even subscription services – will Adobe get away with charging cancellation charges for their subscription service for much longer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or even consider the iPad. What was it’s evolution? I’d postulate that it came about because someone thought that the computers of the time were too “unnatural” for a human to use. Having a user type using a keyboard to communicate something or using a mouse or a track pad to point at something is a hard challenge for people who aren’t familiar with computers. Humans communicate by speaking, they point to things with their fingers. The iPad is a step in that direction. What would the future of this device be? Well, a computer that let’s a user express themselves with all the tools they have at their disposal – from communicating with their voice, pointing with their fingers or even setting the context of what they’re talking about by facing in a particular direction or looking at something with their eyes. The display of the iPad is an intermediate expression of the limitations of current technology. The computer of the future will not be something that is picked up and stared at with your head bent down. If you think the Apple Vision Pro headset is a step in that direction, I would agree that it is. But it’s not the end point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/InstructionMethods.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end point is something that will be even more seamless. It will be an assistant that the user can just converse with, something that can understand the full range of expressions that humans can emote with their faces, eyes, hand gestures, body positions and language and it will be seamless and something that is worn and always available. It will enable the user to do and perform everything they need in the real world but also to understand and appreciate everything much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this to happen, we need a voice assistant with infinite knowledge and ability to learn about the human, wireless technologies that will seamlessly stay connected at all times, face tracking, body tracking, motion tracking, gesture tracking and even battery technology that will not only power something like this, but be in a form that is far more shaped like the person who will wear it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These intermediate states therefore are not dictated not by the human being it is meant to serve, but by other constraints such as materials available, the tools, technologies, the people available to build that next version, legal and environmental constraints, the organisational politics, available marketing budgets or even the designer’s inability to understand who the user is. But knowing that these are necessary stages of evolution will allow the designers to keep their eye on the eventual goal. The task of the product designer or even the entrepreneur building this product is to negotiate the most efficient course between the current state of the product through to the final destination it is meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My experiments with 3D printing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My foray into the world of 3D printing and my learnings and insights so far. This is work in progress and will continue to be edited.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3d-printing-a-journey-into-a-promising-yet-challenging-field&quot;&gt;3D Printing: A Journey into a Promising, Yet Challenging Field&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in around 2015, I stumbled upon 3D printers during their nascent stage. The potential was clear, but the technology wasn’t quite there yet, and it was relegated to a niche space for tech enthusiasts. As a UX designer, my curiosity was piqued, especially considering the initial buzz surrounding its potential impact on ecommerce and logistics. However, being based in India at the time, affordability, availability of replacement parts, and local support were significant barriers to entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2023, I was blown away by an amazing YouTube video showcasing a user designing and printing all the shelves he needed for his desk, as well as custom SD card holders. This experience resonated with me, reminding me of the excitement I get when visiting a hardware store or a craft shop, imagining the possibilities of creating useful things. I was eager to explore this technology further and get my hands on a 3D printer to discover what I could create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-right-printer-for-me-balancing-usability-and-performance&quot;&gt;The Right Printer for Me: Balancing Usability and Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the 3D printing industry evolved, so did its focus on user experience. Although there are numerous resources available online for fine-tuning printers, many models offer excellent results straight out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the printing technologies, I narrowed down my choices to Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) and Vat Polymerisation (VP) printers due to their popularity in the consumer space. VP printing introduced some unique challenges like the need for ventilation and dealing with smells arising from resin. Given that I wanted the printer to remain in my study, I opted for FDM. After thorough research, I selected a printer that offered ease of assembly, maintenance, and accessibility to support. The Bambu Labs X1 and Elegoo Neptune 4 Plus stood out, but ultimately, I went with the Neptune 4 due to its lower cost and absence of proprietary parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unboxing-and-setting-up-overcoming-challenges-together&quot;&gt;Unboxing and Setting Up: Overcoming Challenges Together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delivery took around a month due to pre-ordering, arriving during Christmas holidays, offering ample time for me to delve into learning about 3D printing. The setup was straightforward, but there were some complications like ensuring the correct cables were connected and checking voltage settings on the printer bed. Although these tasks weren’t particularly challenging for a technologically inclined user, they required careful attention and a bit of research to ensure a seamless experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the occasional hurdles, the experience was rewarding, as I was able to build my 3D printer from scratch with all necessary tools supplied. The desktop software that came with the Neptune 4 pleasantly surprised me with pre-installed printable files of a tool stand for the printer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;designing-the-gap-in-the-ux-of-3d-modelling&quot;&gt;Designing: The Gap in the UX of 3D Modelling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design process in 3D modelling is complex and requires a good understanding of visualising 2D cross-sectional shapes to create 3D objects. Sculpting tools like Blender are suitable for creating aesthetically pleasing, non-functional designs, while functional 3D design tools like OnShape offer the best capabilities for product designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OnShape, a cloud-based platform, boasts responsive and great tools that keep users updated with the latest features. However, the pricing could use improvement to cater to hobbyists and make entry into this space more accessible. Simplifying design tools by incorporating user-friendly features specific to 3D printing would further enhance the overall UX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-marketplaces-tools-and-toys-for-everyone&quot;&gt;Design Marketplaces: Tools and Toys for Everyone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Websites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.printables.com&quot;&gt;Printables&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thingiverse.com&quot;&gt;Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt; offer a wealth of user-generated designs, allowing anyone to download and print objects using their 3D printers. This sense of power to create and own is truly exhilarating, enabling users to go from ideation to tangible results in a matter of hours! However, there are challenges like inconsistent quality checks and potential issues with new designers’ designs not being fully optimised for mass consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving the user experience could involve implementing better quality control measures or allowing experienced designers to review and approve new designs before they are released to the public. Additionally, providing more comprehensive information about dimensions, filament requirements, and print time would significantly improve the overall experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;printing-turning-ideas-into-reality&quot;&gt;Printing: Turning Ideas into Reality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Printing in 3D isn’t without its challenges – files need to be converted from design formats (usually STL) to Gcode using slicing software like Cura before being printed. This step involves setting various parameters that determine the quality, strength, and speed of the final print. Although these steps are essential, they can be complex for new users. It is also not apparent to users that they may affect the final look of the object with the changes made to some of these settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streamlining this process by incorporating it into authoring tools would greatly improve the user experience. Until then, there are numerous resources available online to help users learn the intricacies of 3D printing, allowing them to enjoy the satisfaction of turning their ideas into tangible objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion-a-promising-future&quot;&gt;Conclusion: A Promising Future&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential of 3D printing is immense, and I’m confident that significant improvements will be made to address the unique challenges in this space while keeping user experience at the forefront. Like with all the challenges solved in the 2D printing world, I envision 3D printers becoming an integral part of every household or as more likely, in the neighbourhood print shop. The key to realising this lies in simplifying the design authoring tools and making them accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hurdles-and-insights&quot;&gt;Hurdles and Insights&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The plugging in of the cables for the gantry motors still requires some amount of understanding of connectors. This could be further simplified in future versions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The printer plate travels outside the frame of the printer itself which allows a user to make the mistake of placing it too close to a wall and having to learn &lt;em&gt;during printing&lt;/em&gt; that it needs to be moved. This could be explained as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going from 2D to 3D is incredibly difficult and staying in the 3D space from the start would be ideal, but the tools we have today are limited in their ability to express these ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marketplaces are currently aimed at those that own 3D printers, whereas they should be aimed at the end-users of the products that are available on the sites.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are two outcomes to the world of 3D printers, they will either become a part of every household of the future as 2D printers today are, or they will become a part of every neighbourhood print shop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Review of the Rabbit R1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A detailed review of the newly launched Rabbit R1, exploring its hardware and software design, its strategic position in the market and its potential challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-launch-of-something-new&quot;&gt;The Launch of Something New&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that the Rabbit team mimicked Steve Jobs’ keynote would be an understatement! The only thing missing was the Vera Wang turtleneck—it was a black t-shirt instead. Otherwise, the presentation featured the same slide style from Apple Keynote with the gradient, the same format, the hand gestures, and even the “One more thing…” announcement at the end. But OnePlus did this before too, turtleneck included. While it was considered cringe-worthy at the time, the product compensated for the lack of originality in the presentation. So, let’s not dwell on style and focus on the substance instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tech world has been in pursuit of two things over the past couple of years. The first is an answer to what will replace the smartphone. Depending on whom you ask, the smartphone has remained relatively unchanged since its debut in 2007. It has been upgraded in small ways with better screens, cameras, and sensors, but otherwise, the form factor has stayed largely the same since the beginning, despite some major flaws in the structure. But it’s been more than 16 years, Steve Jobs isn’t around, and everyone is looking for the smartphone killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT has demonstrated to everyone how powerful AI assistants can be. The open-source space has also made giant leaps with Llama 2 and Mistral AI models, and you can achieve the same capabilities as ChatGPT, and even the interface, running on your local computer with relative ease using tools like Ollama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the addition of vision, audio, and speech capabilities into AI models, they are now ready to move beyond the browser and integrate into people’s lives, understanding instructions within their own contexts. For this, they may need to leave desktop browser windows and move onto mobile phones instead. But mobile phones are still a reach-into-your-pockets-or-handbag away, and that’s not good enough either. People need something even more readily available. Enter Meta Ray-Ban, Humane’s AI Pin, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, these models have so far been hamstrung by their inability to perform actions on behalf of the user. They cannot yet click buttons on screens and other interfaces, and the OS architecture and security do not allow an app to interact with the interfaces of other apps as yet, and rightly so. But this also means that we have to duplicate actions and information across apps in order to achieve certain goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this backdrop, I think we can evaluate what Rabbit R1 is doing much more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/RabbitR1-2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hardware-design&quot;&gt;Hardware Design&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems they hired &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/@teenageengin33r&quot;&gt;Teenage Engineering&lt;/a&gt; (nice name), which appears to have a penchant for creating retro-futuristic tech products, reminiscent of Dieter Rams’ Braun designs. The design features a very cool, Lego-inspired shell that houses a great-looking touchscreen, a camera on a swivel, a scroll wheel, microphones, a slot for USB and SIM cards, and a push-button on the right side of the product. The touchscreen is a great addition, making interactions with apps, information delivery, and answering questions much faster than the audio-based delivery chosen by the AI Pin by Humane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera on a swivel seems like a good idea, as the R1 can potentially scan the environment to find what a user may be referring to in their instructions. However, the plastic above the camera prevents the device from being held at an angle less than about 45 degrees, meaning the user must position the device almost vertically, like a smartphone, for the camera to see. This is odd, and I’m not sure why this choice was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not just position the camera on the very edge without the top plastic part causing an obstruction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/RabbitR1-3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also struggling to understand the purpose of the analogue scroll wheel. Is it meant to help make selections within the touchscreen interface? That doesn’t seem likely, as it would potentially be faster to use your finger to scroll on the touchscreen itself. Is it intended for manually positioning the camera? If so, positioning it to the right of the camera would have been more logical. Is the idea to enable one-handed scrolling on the touchscreen? If I were holding the device in my left hand, using my index finger to scroll might be easier than using my thumb on the screen, but I would still need to make button selections, and for that, I might be hitting the push-button. This seems like a learned behaviour, but it’s the only explanation I can come up with given my limited understanding. However, if you hold this device in your right hand, the positioning of the scroll wheel becomes even more perplexing! You can’t scroll with the thumb that’s holding the side of the device, and you can’t use your left hand to operate the scroll wheel without blocking your view of the screen. So, why is it designed this way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I didn’t notice any way for the product to be attached to a jacket or shirt, and the placement of the screen and push-button suggests that the R1 is intended to be carried in a pocket and pulled out when needed. This raises a significant concern for me. An AI companion needs to be readily accessible within the user’s physical space to understand instructions better (and to keep the instructions simpler). If it needs to be pulled out of a pocket—or more likely from a bag, since the smartphone will probably be in the pocket—it won’t be as easily accessible. The AI Pin addressed this better by being always accessible from the t-shirt or jacket where it is clipped. The Meta Ray-Ban was another good attempt, but since they are sunglasses, wearing them all the time is nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;software-design&quot;&gt;Software Design&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesse Lyu, the founder and CEO, begins his keynote by recognising one of the most fundamental issues with the way smartphones are designed. This is an extremely deep insight, and I’m so glad someone on such a large stage was able to express it. During the early days of the smartphone, Apple proudly used the line, “There’s an app for that,” in their marketing to highlight how many apps there were in the App Store. You see, in their view, there was an app that could achieve any task that you wanted to do. But the mental model of a person who wants to perform a specific task requires them to choose the app that would enable them to do it, then open that app and make the right choices in the interface in order to achieve the task. If you’ve got more than one app that could help you do that task, there’s some time spent in your mind deciding between them. And if you have a task that needs more than one app to be achieved, you’ve just made the choices even more complex. Given that most people have about 90 different apps on their phones on average, this isn’t a small matter. You also need to have downloaded these apps ahead of time in anticipation of needing them in the future. But that’s another story altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also third-generation thinking, where you have to consider the objective you need to achieve and then break it down into the steps required for the computer to help you achieve it. Contrast that with fourth-generation thinking, which simply requires the user to clearly express the goal, and the computer then breaks down the tasks into atomic bits, figures out the best tools to use to solve the problem, and solves it. This was science fiction before the advent of AI. This is reality today. There’s also the duplication of data and instructions between the apps to contend with. For example, travelling somewhere on a vacation requires an app for flight bookings, an app for hotel bookings, an app to book a ride, and another to research the highlights of the destination. Each of them will ask you for your name, dates, times, locations, your companions, your preferences, over and over again. And that’s not even considering the fact that you need to register with each app too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a problem today, and Jesse and his company used this idea as the foundation to build their solution to combat this problem. Kudos to them for being able to figure out a way around it with their Rabbit Hole interface, even though it doesn’t yet completely solve &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the problems. There’s much more to say about the software, the interfaces, and the UI design, which are all brilliant but table stakes for a game this big. The fact that they understood the above point and also broke through the 500ms (while not yet hitting the Doherty Threshold) makes the device feel really responsive, which is just amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;business-design&quot;&gt;Business Design&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the product was launched at $199 is simply a masterstroke. A device that purports to be an AI Companion is really only that useful today, and the price point is perfect. But how could they not have a recurring monthly fee? They must have servers running in the background to serve the needs of the users. How do they expect to fund this? To me, this is where the rabbit hole comes in. I think the apps need to pay to be listed there. Maybe not initially, but eventually. They also may have a local model running on the device that handles the majority of the daily queries and only passes along the complex ones to the server, à la &lt;a href=&quot;https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/&quot;&gt;Mixtral of Experts&lt;/a&gt;. This would keep their costs low too. There is a possibility that they will benefit from a model that understands the physical world of the user better. This is greenfield at the moment, and they are going to be one of the first to occupy this space. But this is me just conjecturing, and the answer may be far simpler; the operational costs may just be borne through VC funding until they hit some kind of threshold. Or maybe it has to do with advertising, a.k.a. “recommendations” that the agent provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The R1 is intriguing and addresses some key concerns of mobile computing. However, several challenges persist. While the Rabbit R1 excels in software, the hardware design falls short of being an effective AI companion. A smartwatch with a camera still remains the form factor to beat. Given these shortcomings, I predict limited usage and abandonment by most users within a few months unless these improvements are implemented by the time they start shipping in March. With regard to competition, this concept could easily be replicated by smartphone manufacturers. If they cannot produce it independently, an acquisition could be on the cards, which may be the anticipated endgame anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any AI companion, the major obstacle remains payments. The demo didn’t quite show how the many payments that were alluded to actually took place, and I’m curious to see how this aspect works. While I don’t personally wish to purchase this product due to the aforementioned issues and deficiencies, I still regard it as a ‘directional innovation’ that pushes the industry in the right direction. There will be numerous iterations before the ideal form factor for the product is realised, as well as the perfect business models for the companies backing them. Consequently, I intend to keep a close eye on Jesse and his team to see if they adapt and iterate as I anticipate they will.&lt;/p&gt;
