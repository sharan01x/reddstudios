        <title>The Age of Goal Based Computing is Here</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among the many things AI has enabled, it has now made possible an entirely new method of interacting with our computers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://redd.in/blog/5-personal-ai-assistant-devices-reviewed/&quot;&gt;long believed&lt;/a&gt; that we are on the precipice of changing the fundamental way in which humans will interact with computers. We are stepping into an age where we are going to simply be able to tell our computers the goals we want to achieve and they will figure out the steps in order to achieve it and then execute it for us. But this powerful idea is founded on the notion that your computer will know what there is to know about you, including your preferences, your data and whatever else you can supply it. But that brings up many new questions regarding privacy, data ownership and data residency. But don’t worry, I’m not here just to whine, (though I will), but I also come bearing a solution and even ways for you to participate in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin to understand the importance of what we’re currently living through, it is important for me to provide you a bit of background about three aspects of this industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I want to point out the evolution of computing from the perspective of how much effort it takes to have your computer do what you need it to do, the effort has been reducing over time. We’ve gone from writing our instructions on punch cards to writing programs using almost english sounding programming languages like BASIC or Python. After that, the evolution plateaued until the birth of LLMs. Now, we can speak to them in natural language and have them do things for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/GoalBasedComputing-EffortOverTime.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph showning effort over time to have computers understand us&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second progression that I want you to pay attention to is the number of things a particular program is capable of doing. You see, at first you needed to employ programmers in your office to write you custom programs because there was just no other way to having your company use the efficiency that computers could bring to your organisation. Post that phase, applications were available to people to just download, install and use. Now app developers who were competing for the user’s dollars, either built apps to serve a niche audience or started building super-apps that could do everything. The latter group quickly ran into the limitations of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) because there was only so many things you can pack into a screen and still be user-friendly. This was the case, again, until LLMs. Now you had computers that could do anything, even write programs to do specific things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, apps have been very specific solutions to a problem. As such, they’ve been very brittle as you could only ask the app to do certain things and that’s it. Even when speech technology was applied, you still spent time learning the phrases that you could use a la, “Hey Google, turn my lights on in the living room”. If you said that phrase differently than it had been setup with, for example, if you said, “Hey, it’s too dark in the living room” – you couldn’t expect your app to understand that phrase. This hurdle again has been overcome by LLM’s because they can understand your meaning &lt;em&gt;past&lt;/em&gt; your words. For example, you could say “I’m thirsty”, “I’m parched” or even be euphemistic like “My mouth feels like the Sahara desert right now” and it would still get the meaning you want to convey. From a UX perspective, this ability for technology to fit into the life of human beings seamless is what I find most powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are at the threshold of these three progressions having come to a head at once. This means that not only are our computers going to be super capable going forward, it’s going to be incredibly simple to use and no one has to spend any time even learning them. Can you imagine what an unlock this is for society? And this is the first time in history that the benefits of this technology is not just going to those of us who grew up with technology in our lives and we’ve found it comfortable because we spent the time learning them, it’s going to be a massive unlock for those that were so far left behind the technological divide or even the english-language.  These include people like my parents who find their smartphones challenging to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;context-is-everything&quot;&gt;Context is Everything&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For AI systems to go from just being effective on the baseline (based on what it’s learnt about humans as a whole from the internet) to doing things for you the way you prefer it be done requires understanding your context. They need to be able to study your behaviours and patterns in order to be able to emulate them. This may mean giving the AI access to not just your emails, calendars, contacts, photos but even allow it to watch your health data, medical records, your passwords, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when they can go to a place where they can understand that you prefer to say “clutch” over “cool” or like to order from this particular Chinese restaurant and the other one is there as a backup or that you prefer your screen font size large because you have trouble reading or even to cancel all your appointments automatically if you woke up unwell one day. It can figure all this out without you ever having to tell it these things explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But AI isn’t just going to be a useful assistant to have, it will soon become essential. We live in a world where information is being produced at unprecedented rates and we feel compelled to keep up. But we are reaching the limits of human capabilities and that’s just going to continue to be the case. There will be hundreds of decisions that we can delegate to AI that’s working on our behalf, the least of which is deciding which email is spam and which isn’t. If you want to participate in an accelerating world, having an AI assistant will become a necessity in the same way having a smartphone today is seen as a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the question is, where do you get your AI assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;shop-around&quot;&gt;Shop Around&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing we’ve learnt from the mistakes made by the social media decade is that if the service is free, you are the product. We’ve also seen the many ways data about users have been used against them. To most readers of this blog, I don’t need to list the kinds of things these large technology companies learn about us just through the ways in which we shop or even the intonations of our voice. We’ve seen how effective and accurate they have been, including stories about products being suggested to dads of teenagers who were pregnant, even before the dad knew about that pregnancy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would never trust these corporations with my context data, especially when that data could reveal infinitely more information than my social media profile ever could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear, I don’t think these corporations are necessarily evil. I find it hard to imagine anyone waking up every morning with the sole intention to destroy other people’s lives. But the incentives of corporations are definitely not aligned to serving the user. They are beholden to their shareholders and are mandated with generating profits for them. This mechanism doesn’t allow anyone to see the user as anything more than a resource to derive value from. If value can be generated by selling their data to the highest bidder, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this equation, let’s suppose you go ask a question about a certain type of cancer to the AI assistant from one of these large corporations or submitted a scan to this assistant with the intention of getting a second opinion. What if that AI assistant saw that and realised that your insurance company may be willing to pay a huge amount for that information because they could loose a lot more if they continue to cover you if you fell ill. Do you think the assistant would be programmed to act on your behalf or to generate a profit for the corporation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that we don’t need to rely on these corporations. The open source world has realised these pitfalls and have been hard at work developing technologies that will ensure that this kind of a future doesn’t need to befall us. I also realise how important these efforts are and have been contributing my time and efforts to such projects as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-solution-is-simple&quot;&gt;The Solution is Simple&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these big companies that own the frontier AI models want to portray themselves as the only option for this sort of intelligence, don’t be fooled. Know that you can have absolutely great stuff available to you without any of them in the picture. You can retain complete ownership of your data while still getting all the convenience. You can do all this locally, in the privacy of your own computer. You don’t have to learn prompting strategies either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can install Ollama and Move 37 on your machine and you’re good to go! All of it is completely free and you can even check and audit the code if you’re so inclined. Granted it’s a little bit of work to get this installed right now, but they are all making things easier all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to see a demo of this, I’d be happy to create one. If you want to find out how to install this also, I can create another video about it. But for now, here’s a very quick walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[COMING SOON]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, these two projects are available for free, from these locations. So go check them out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ollama.com&quot;&gt;Ollama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sharan01x/move37&quot;&gt;Move37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe in an open future where individuals retain control over their own destinies, you can start using these technologies for yourself. But if you feel like you’d want to contribute more and be a part of these movements, there are many ways you can participate depending on your skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re technically inclined:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Move37 is looking for help in testing, verifying the code completeness and various other items listed in their roadmap.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UX designers can propose new ways to organise the frontend to make things easier and more efficient.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The installation process could use a lot of simplifying and that’s something that you can contribute to, especially on Move37.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not an engineer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use and provide feedback and spot bugs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spread the word and get more people to realise the problem and understand that there are solutions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create videos talking about the projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add new recipes – the steps for using various applications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suggest new ideas and features that can be built&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Star the projects on GitHub so that they get more visibility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just donate to the projects if you’ve got the money, they can use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever you choose, thanks for being a part of this! Until next time, ciao!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Review of Replit, the Figma Killer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Replit has been thought of as a tool that will replace Figma. I tested it out to see if that is true.&lt;/em&gt;
___&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my previous video, I wondered why design and coding tools had to be different and require constant translation when moving between them. Just two days later, Paul Graham tweeted that one of his well-known companies had ditched Figma in favour of Replit — validation that my curiosity was onto something big. As someone always eager to explore innovative tools, I couldn’t resist diving in myself. In this review, I’ll walk you through my experience with Replit and share whether it truly lives up to the hype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I must say that this article is in no way sponsored by Replit. I paid for the account myself and used the software and these opinions are mine alone. I got myself the $25/month plan. I paid extra per month firstly because I was just testing this out, but also because I feel that committing to a single platform for a whole year makes no sense when new tools are being developed and released all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;using-replit&quot;&gt;Using Replit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;objective&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my objective was simple:  I wanted to prompt my way into bringing a working product to life and it needed to have the UX and UI that I wanted for it. The application that I was trying to build was one that could be used to take notes during meetings, summarise it and then share it with the user. I chose this as it’s not too complex but also not as easy as the demo apps that have been shown to work in a lot of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;third-attempt&quot;&gt;Third Attempt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After signing up, I was presented this box that asked what I wanted to build today. In my first two attempts, I said that I wanted to build an audio recording application that does such and such. For some reason this just didn’t work. It failed miserably, but we’ll talk more about it later on. So what I describe here is my third attempt where I changed tactics and tried to approach this in a very non-technical way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began by stating that I wanted to build an app that would take notes during meetings. I further specified that there should be a toggle button to start and stop recordings, that it should clearly indicated that it is active and also send the recordings to a server for processing where it would be transcribed and the meeting notes generated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t specifically mention any platforms or specifications of the UI. I was hesitant to provide too much detail as I have seen AI agents breakdown because of this. Providing too little detail also doesn’t usually provide me the output that I want, so I’m never quite sure exactly how much detail I needed to provide. But there’s a helpful, “Improve Prompt” button and I’ve seen that clicking these usually provides the level of detail that is expected by the system. So I clicked it and it added details about the UI itself and chose “dark mode” for some reason. I’m not a fan, but I don’t hate it enough to want to change it for a trial app, so I just went ahead and asked it to start building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interesting things happened at this point. It started “Thinking…” and after a few seconds came back and reiterated what it thought I wanted it to build. Mind you, I had just asked it to improve my prompt, so from my perspective it was already aware of what it was supposed to build, so when it said something like, “So you want to build…” with added surprise like it had become aware of this message for the very first time, it felt like I was talking to a moron, not something that was going to make things any easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like I’m splitting hairs here. I know the system needs to confirm what’s been understood, but I have seen more and more AI based interfaces use these conversational style interfaces and end up making this mistake of not keeping the user’s context in mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the good thing was that it suggested additional features that I could add on to my initial request. The suggestions were great and extremely relevant, but, not something I really needed to consider at this moment. This was really mis-timed and should have been something that was suggested after the main request was completed (which it actually does). It would have made more sense to ask questions that it needed clarifications on at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, my experience with using AI based tools to create applications has taught me that it is better to start small and then build up the set of features that you want. So you need to do some planning yourself actually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I asked it to just go ahead and build out the basic application first and then it began whirring away. The chat flow moved to the left and the right side showed a section called “Progress” and lots of things started to fly by. Pieces of code, snapshots of interfaces and more pieces of code, more snapshots, a database getting created, dependencies being installed, etc. and then finally, after about 3 to 5 minutes, it stopped, a panel slid up with the application in view (this is a nice feature by the way), and then in the chat, it asked me to confirm if the interface was visible to me. It had been taking snapshots until now, so I wasn’t sure what the question was. I clicked around on the interface and saw all the required components were indeed there. I clicked the microphone button and saw that nothing really happened. So I assumed that this is what was supposed to happen and so I responded in the chat stating that exactly, that the interface looked fine but nothing functioned as yet. But it didn’t quite respond to me and instead just went ahead and started building out the functionality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I saw a whole lot of code flash by and then it finally stopped and asked me to test out the functionality. To my utter amazement the application worked and even had a nice visualisation and everything. I started recording, said a few things and when I stopped it, it saved the recording and then moved it to the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The layout was a little messed up and I also needed to improve the algorithm behind the uploading to the server bit, because it was possible that the mobile phone that is recording the meeting isn’t always going to be able to stay connected to the server. So in such circumstances, it should save the recordings locally and then try to attempt to push the recording to the server whenever it connects again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-changes&quot;&gt;Making Changes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having made some edits in the previous attempts, I realised what was possible to edit and what wasn’t. So I just cut to the chase and got rid of troublesome elements and made it make some changes that I needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to add additional features quite easily, but when I tried to ask it to work on a feature to mitigate upload issues and instead, to chunk the uploads in 10 second blocks and then try to upload it to the server, it failed to do this level of a complex task. But at this time, when I tried to go back to a previous checkpoint where things were working, it completely failed that and it seemed like it’s roll-back wasn’t well done. It seems that when it comes to using AI tools for development and prototyping work, there’s no going back, only forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;failures&quot;&gt;Failures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one early attempt that I made where Replit hit an obstacle that it couldn’t surmount. It gave me 3 options to continue trying,  try a different approach or to rewrite the whole thing in a completely different way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I responded in the chat stating that exactly, that the interface looked fine but nothing functioned as yet. But it didn’t quite respond to me and instead just went ahead and started building out the functionality. There was a stop button and I clicked that but by that time, I think some code was written and that was that. It was a bad build and I just couldn’t recover from that point onwards. I had to scrap the project and begin again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-templates&quot;&gt;Using Templates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even thought that I am making my life difficult by trying to build an app from scratch. There are a lot of templates available on Replit and I thought I’d try that out. But when I use a template, the AI Agent is no longer available to me and I can only talk to the AI Assistant that cannot write the code like the agent. I thought this was really strange and I didn’t proceed with using the templates even though they seemed really appealing to me as starting points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;lessons-learnt&quot;&gt;Lessons Learnt&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a very informative experience for me. When I used the trial version, it ran out of available credits. If you’ve watched an older video of mine, you know that I have tried using GitHub Copilot and Windsurf and I ran into some problems there that made the left the development experience wanting. So I was actually really looking forward to trying out Replit because I had heard so much about it. But here’s where I think things are at with Replit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-multiple-attempts-is-required&quot;&gt;Making multiple attempts is required&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen this with other coding agents and it’s kind of interesting that I am seeing the same pattern occur here, but your chances of creating the application that you want in one shot is next to impossible. You need to go through the process multiple times like a video game and running into different bosses and striking out and then starting making sure to avoid those pitfalls when you try to build it all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;start-small-and-then-add-on&quot;&gt;Start small and then add on&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Replit provides you the options to add a whole number of features all at the beginning, it’s not a good idea. I think it’s best to start with the barebones version of the application first and then once you have that bit working, add on new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;editing-the-ui-is-hard&quot;&gt;Editing the UI is hard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I referenced elements on the screen by a certain logical name, it wasn’t always understood by the agent. But since there’s no way to point at a thing and identify them, it just wasn’t possible to edit some elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also didn’t see where the files were until much later, so going through the code and referring to a specific element just wasn’t easy either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I used UI strategies where I worked around the need for these difficult elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;checkpoints-dont-work-well&quot;&gt;Checkpoints don’t work well&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I realised that the checkpoints weren’t working as expected and weren’t as reliable, I began downloading the files at the points where I felt I had things functioning just like I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there was a point where I chose the wrong checkpoint that was a much earlier version of the code where things had been working. Once it tried to restore to that point, there was no way to go forward to the next checkpoint instead. This was severely frustrating for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;couldnt-bring-it-to-life&quot;&gt;Couldn’t bring it to life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the three attempts, I couldn’t bring the project to life. I downloaded the code and while I tried to get it to function locally, I haven’t been able to install the database and build the structure as yet. There’s no file backup for the database elements, so I’ve got to figure this out on my own. I’m really not looking forward to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;bottom-line&quot;&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-there-yet&quot;&gt;Not there yet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what Paul Graham’s acquaintance was thinking when they’ve committed to working with Replit and remove Figma. I don’t think Replit is there yet. Can they get there in the future? I sure hope so. But will I be replacing Figma, Framer and Windsurf right now? No, not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ux-is-not-great&quot;&gt;UX is not great&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you watch some videos of Replit from before, you’ll notice that the agent chat window has gone from being the ancillary element on the right to the primary element on the left. This signals that they thing of code and files as secondary elements to writing the code right now. But they haven’t evolved fully as yet. In order to appeal to designers or non-developers, the interface needs to be able to refer to elements and operate them in different ways. As an example, if I had a way to point at elements on the right-side preview pane, it would have made my life so very easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they need to provide a way to build and utilise design systems at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;really-not-meant-to-create-stuff-you-have-in-mind&quot;&gt;Really not meant to create stuff you have in mind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that if I begin with a very specific idea in my mind and try to recreate that using Replit, it’s going to be super hard if not impossible. So this tool really isn’t about doing that, but instead to explore new ideas and interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I gave Replit exactly the same set of commands in the same order, I don’t think it would arrive at the same output at the end. That’s a challenge for anyone that wants to have any kind of control over the outcomes. But for exploration, it’s a fine approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-wouldnt-build-anything-large-or-serious&quot;&gt;I wouldn’t build anything large or serious&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, I have to assume that I need to attempt to build the project multiple times. This limits the kinds of things I can do with Replit. I cannot imagine building a large application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the project that was output in the end felt like a precarious Jenga tower, I am not exactly certain that this application would perform well in production. I’m just not that confident. If it’s a blog or a static website, that’s an entirely different matter and I probably wouldn’t feel the same way about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deployment-is-a-nice-touch&quot;&gt;Deployment is a nice touch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Claude and OpenAI demonstrated the artefacts panel in their interfaces. I found that to be extremely important because we could avoid the environment setup and things like that. With Replit, they’ve taken that to the next level by including deployment. So not only can you test and see stuff while building it, you don’t have to deal with deployment issues that are all too common when you’re ready to push the app and make it live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;local-software-incompatibility&quot;&gt;Local software incompatibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest issues that you will face with Replit and it’s ilk is that you cannot have it interface with locally running software. In this example itself, I had the option of having this app work with Ollama installed locally because I would actually be running many tests and didn’t want to hook it up to OpenAI. But there was no way to do this that I could figure out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;theyre-straddling-two-boats-and-need-to-commit&quot;&gt;They’re straddling two boats and need to commit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s perfectly natural for every startup to pivot when they find new product-market-fits, I think Replit is currently mid-pivot as they haven’t really committed to building tools for non-developers as yet. They began as a developer focussed tool to begin with, and they haven’t completely changed their focus and redesigned the older tools to suit the needs of designers and other non-developers. Once they commit, I think I would expect a lot more from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never hit “Cancel Subscription” on any tool faster than I did with Replit. The task they’ve undertaken is hard, but they’re not yet where they need to be to get me as a user. My experience developing an application was much better with Windsurf (in conjunction with Perplexity) and I’ll be going back to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if this blog has somehow made its way to the Replit team, I would happily invite them to a chat with me as I can recommend many more things that they could do to get users like me on board. Otherwise, I wish them well and hope to use their software after a few months to see if it will suit me then. Until then, I wish them luck!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The app-less world and it&apos;s implications on the world of computing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among the many things AI has enabled, it now has made it possible to think beyond building software applications.&lt;/em&gt;
___&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I have [[2024-09-12-5-personal-ai-assistant-devices-reviewed#^1c44a7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;long believed]] that we are on the precipice of changing the fundamental way in which humans will interact with computers. Humans will soon be in a place where they can think in terms of the goals they want to achieve rather than thinking about the apps they need to string together in order to achieve the various pieces of it. The required technological pieces such as the [[2024-01-10-rabbit-r1-review#^a18b65&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;LAM]] and [[2024-12-30-the-new-age-of-design#^5b3b30&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Just-in-Time Code]] being developed makes me believe that we are getting closer to this becoming real. There is still one big piece of the puzzle that is necessary which is the context of the user, but it’s only a matter of time and this will be achieved.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;data&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of the writing of this article, the entities that have data about us are the large corporations that have spent years amassing it from our interactions in the digital sphere. They run very large data centres to store and process all this data to understand the user’s context and preferences. Hundreds and thousands of lines of code have been written to do this. So far it’s been employed to serve us ads or sell us stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we are now at a place where the hardware required for the user to be able to record this data about themselves is cheap enough that they could do this at their own homes. Open Source AI engines are also sophisticated and capable enough to replace the need for the many lines of code and instead be able to mine this data to understand the user’s preferences or to know what they said in the previous meeting whenever it is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;digital-twin&quot;&gt;Digital Twin&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in theory, we can build a “digital twin” of a user that exists entirely in a computer that’s owned and controlled by them. This digital twin will be useful in so many ways. For instance, it can be examined to understand their preferred cuisine in order to order lunch or even to identify signs of depression if it comes to that. This digital twin is also available at all hours, so can represent the human in many digital spheres while the human is asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ai-agents&quot;&gt;AI Agents&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI agents are becoming more and more capable. They are able to search the web, make API calls, do calculations, make good decisions, write code, use computers and software applications and do it using multi-modal inputs and outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very quickly, this AI agent can learn to perform any tasks that the human may perform. The user will begin to speak to their agents in terms of the goals they want to achieve and leave it to the agent to figure out the plan and break it down into tasks that will help achieve that goal. The agent will operate software applications in oder to achieve these tasks. The human will use it to interact with and execute everything certainly in the digital sphere, but maybe some things in the physical world too (taxi hailing, ordering food or products, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These agents can also filter their actions through the Digital Twin in order to make choices and decisions just as the user would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the AI agent becomes the universal interface for the user. This may happen gradually at first, but there is a real possibility that this becomes indispensable soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if the agent is capable of writing code as required to perform a task, software as we know it will not be necessary anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, if the primary user of websites and applications is the AI agent, they will cease to exist in their current form and become far more like API’s. Future app-stores will be selling specialised data bundles or algorithms that will help analyse the user’s own data in novel ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, with the human interacting more with the agent than with computers or phones, this may reduce their dependence on technology. We may finally settle on computing form factors such as the smart watch in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The New Age of the Design Generalist</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI tools have made coding simpler. Skills are no longer relevant. Imagination and envisioning a particular future is more necessary than ever.&lt;/em&gt;
___&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-boring-part&quot;&gt;The ‘Boring’ Part&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been having a lot of difficulty in staying on top of my social media game. Not being a native to social media, I approached it with a certain disdain in the beginning and completely missed the wave. But given the new course I have set upon, I intend to learn as much as I can and get better at this now.️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the tedious aspect of social media has got to be the manual process of posting content on each and every channel that I have become a part of. That’s the biggest hurdle and the most boring aspect of the entire process. There are some tools, and I subscribed to Typefully to be able to do this. But, alas, Typefully doesn’t support the social platforms on Web3 that I am a part of. So I looked for various solutions and none of them satisfied my needs. It occurred to me to try building an application that would do this for myself with the help of AI and I am so glad I did because, a whole new world has opened up to me now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began down this path in the usual way that one builds software these days. I got access to ChatGPT, but I found the idea of copy-pasting between the chat interface and VS Code tedious and quite problematic as I am not a very good developer and often made mistakes with where I copied and pasted from. Github Copilot Chat was like having the same ChatGPT capability but repurposed for use within VS Code, though I still had to copy and paste between panels. But GitHub Copilot has a new feature called “Edits” which would directly make the edits to your code. This made things a whole lot more convenient. I could even describe what I wanted to do in plain english and it would make the right edits directly in my code. This was a game-changer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with my new setup in place, I began by describing what I intended to achieve at a high level and asked it to recommend the right technology stack. It recommended that I built with Vue.js for my intended purpose, I said “Fine” and it began whirring away setting up the environment with all the required files and started to build out my views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what the limitations were going to be, so I wanted to do a trial project first. I gave it some instructions for a “Hello World” program and it performed it beautifully and I got it to work as expected without much difficulty. The trouble came afterwards where I asked it to scrap the trial project and begin working on the real one. It completely couldn’t figure out how to take steps backwards. It was easier for me to delete the entire project folder and start again, so that’s what I did. But it also highlighted to me that this would be a limitation I would have to deal with using this tool. So I had to chart a course of building features one by one while I get to the final version without having to remove or modify the previously built feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my plan, I was going to build a social media posting utility that would allow me to post across multiple channels by supplying it with a single post. So the simplest form of that application was going to be a feature that would post a message on a single channel first, then I would add a drop-down with additional channels and then create a broadcaster that would post across every channel, then a scheduler, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach worked out rather well. I had to learn to be very specific at times and very broad at other times and that was straightforward enough. But I hit a road block when, after building out the functionality, I wanted to improve the UI and started making fixes. Now these fixes needed to be made across all the interfaces, but for some reason it had a lot of difficulty doing this across the various modules that I had built. It got to bad that I decided to use an entirely different front-end framework that would keep things standardised out of the box so that I would have to do very minimal work in order to make the UI look good. I chose to build the application with Streamlit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I heard about Windsurf as an AI infused IDE and saw the demo video and it looked great, even better than Copilot Edits. So I downloaded it and built a simple demo application with the trial credits. It was simply an entirely different experience. I simply describe the application I wanted to build and broke it down into the steps that were going to be required to achieve that and since I had it in the “Write” mode, where it could make file edits and changes, it simply went about doing everything. If I was impressed with Copilot Edits, this blew my socks off. I had the entire application setup and ready to go with Windsurf taking some incredibly good decisions regarding the things I hadn’t mentioned. It even named all the modules and variables in the code as I would have done myself! It was simply outstanding. I was able to achieve what I could with GitHub Copilot over the 5 or 6 days in a matter of 1 day. It did help that I was doing this a second time around, so I knew what the right approach was and didn’t make as many mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Windsurf hasn’t been without it’s flaws. There were two times where I asked it to write a module “like the edits that you made to the Twitter module…” and it not only wrote the new module in the way it had done the Twitter module, but went too far and made edits to other modules. I had to learn to limit its scope by adding “Do only this and don’t make any other edits” to my instructions and that stopped the problematic edits from being performed. So, the very thing that it was great at and extremely useful at the beginning stages of an application became it’s Achilles heel later on. It was quite literally the opposite of GitHub Edits in this regard. So, the workflow that I would use for future application development is to use Windsurf in the beginning stages of the application and then switch to GitHub Copilot for specific edits and module-level enhancements. But of course, I am talking about their qualities as of today. I completely expect that the teams behind these two tools will find ways to integrate the best features of each other’s AI code companions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t meant to be a discussion on the usage of these tools at all. Creating a video about the right ways to work with these AI tools is a fool’s errand because these tools have obviously been built by very smart people that really do understand what they’re bringing to this world and they will keep making improvements until these tools work just the right way it is meant to be by it’s users. No, it’s a discussion about the fact that I now stand in front of a very designed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; well built application that does exactly what I want it to do! The implications of this has in equal parts shaken me and blown my mind, and I had to talk about that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-interesting-part&quot;&gt;The Interesting Part&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are the changes that I expect to see on the horizon. There are numerous impacts of the stuff that I’ve been doing that I can see and I’ve done my best to list them in a logical order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;os&quot;&gt;OS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, these tools, in their current form have made a huge leap forward in the span of a year. The capabilities of frontier and open-source AI models are only going to become better over time. This will allow them to factor more parameters into their operations. In other words, you will be able to communicate with the AI engines in as many ways as you need, speaking some actions, writing out some others and even supplying your Figma designs straight into the LLM’s for them to understand and execute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, if you extend that idea, one may ask, why couldn’t the AI write the program at the time of need? Or even better, couldn’t the AI &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; the application necessary to do the tasks and instead of providing a chat interface, provide the interface that an application would provide a user. A majority of applications are simply interfaces over some data source, so while there are many qualifiers to this sentence, the short answer is yes, it truly can become that super app and replace the user-facing part of the operating system. The OS will be relegated to managing security, permissions and managing the hardware interfaces. ^5b3b30&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this world, where would UX design fit in? If an AI can understand the best ways humans interact with interfaces, they can not only produce those interfaces with scarily effective interfaces, but also tune it to the needs of a single individual, no longer serving only the needs of the majority. In such a world, what role would a human UX designer play? I fear, it will no longer be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;roles&quot;&gt;Roles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short-term however, the role of the UX designer will change. They will no longer be beholden to a developer and their capabilities anymore and can circumvent them and develop a great application on their own – just as a developer will no longer need a designer for the applications they will create. As AI takes over more tasks, traditional design roles are likely to shift from execution-oriented to focus on strategic direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job will be to instruct AI agents to perform the required tasks in the manner in which it needs to be done in order to achieve the goal. So practical imagination and planning will be the skills that will set us apart going forward. People like lead designers or lead design organisations are going to be much better equipped to jump into this role more naturally than anyone else. But this is only for the short-term and they too will need to go up the chain and up-skill themselves to think like entrepreneurs in the long term, because AI will take over the planning aspect as well soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current design tools are built for specialists and therefore are designed for precision. You can edit just this pixel, move exactly this screen and change exactly this effect. However AI can handle the details and the tools of the future are going to be designed around doing things with broad strokes. So it can take inputs like, “a background of a desert dune” or “a login flow with 2FA”, instead. The broad strokes are just going to get broader over time with humans being able to specify things in a increasingly abstracted manner. If you look at Krea.ai as an example and see what they’re doing with the Edit feature and compare that with the Photoshop workflow, this aspect will become even more evident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logically, this also means that the target audience is going to change. It’s no longer going to be appealing only to a graphic designer anymore but an entrepreneur running a company could use Krea, today, with little to no knowledge of graphic design and create some stunning artwork for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;economies-of-scale&quot;&gt;Economies of Scale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of the economy will also change within the digital space. One of the biggest challenges in the software industry has been to design features that appeal to every individual. But because it costs a lot to design, code, test and release a certain feature, the decision has always been skewed towards appealing to the majority of users and ignoring the fringe needs. But with AI in the mix, this very dynamic can change. As I was discussing before, every feature and interface can be built to appeal to the individual user. Maybe the workflow will be that the human orchestrated output will be the feature that appeals to the majority of users, but AI can use that as a starting point and fill in the gaps to make that feature work for the fringe users? This changes the entire industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unexpected-benefactors&quot;&gt;Unexpected Benefactors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest benefactors of the economies of scale change are going to be the group of people that are currently disadvantaged by the digital world today. For example, these could be people with eyesight challenges or even the elderly that have so far been left behind by the digital world and are left more and more unsafe because of it. My own father keeps sending me fake videos of various things completely believing whatever thee video says. And since he’s at high risk in a digital world, I have had to ask him to not do any digital banking and completely prevented him from using UPI and such. My mother is unable to use these technologies as she’s a non-native-English-speaker and most interfaces are designed for English. Imagine user interfaces that will adapt to them without additional costs to the software developer. They would finally be able to cross the chasm and join the rest of the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-generalist&quot;&gt;The Generalist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this AI assisted world, there is a power-shift taking place. The users of AI are going to be able to build anything they can imagine. You no longer are constrained by needing a large team to execute on your vision. A lot of the roles of the team that one needed to build in the past can be executed by an AI agent today. It’s only going to be able to handle more roles in the future. This means that the required capital to build the companies of the future is only going to reduce. It therefore means that more and more people with the imagination and desire to do something will simply be able to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical entrepreneur today is a generalist that understands a little bit of all the pieces that are required to execute something and can bring all those pieces together. Broadly speaking, they identify the need in the market, develop a vision for the solution to the problem, then they bring in specialists to fill in the gaps and capitalists to provide the capital required, and create the culture required to execute on the vision. It’s this very person’s role that will be made infinitely better in the future. In the digital world, we’re ushering in the dawn of the age of the generalist.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to start designing for Web3</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Web3 is a burgeoning field, but you can’t just take Web2 designs and expect them to work in Web3. What should you keep in mind?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-go-from-designing-ux-in-web2-to-web3&quot;&gt;How to go from designing UX in Web2 to Web3&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web3 has been built by engineers, for engineers, until now. But the recent DevCon conference hosted by the Ethereum community in Bangkok had a huge focus on user experience and that’s never happened before. Given how geeky this community has been, even talking about usability is a huge step! There’s a shift from focusing on building infrastructure to building applications on top of that now that a lot of the required infrastructure is in place. There’s a clear realisation within the community to focus on usability with the intention of attracting the mainstream population. This presents an unprecedented opportunity for designers. But transitioning hasn’t been easy and this article intends to make that part simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;firstly-understand-web3&quot;&gt;Firstly, Understand Web3&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As UX designers know, to design something effective, we need to begin by understanding as much as possible about the technology underneath. To that end, let’s begin by understanding what is different about Web3 in contrast with Web2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-different-stack&quot;&gt;1. Different Stack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Web2, you have companies that own the entire application stack – they own the servers, the databases, the back-end software, the payment layer and the front-end UI layer. Users go to these companies and create accounts with them and their usage information is stored on the databases owned and operated by these same companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Web3, the network is composed of a huge number of nodes and they are the equivalents of a web server in Web2. The front-end may be built by the company and the users that want to use the software can just sign-in with their wallets and begin using it. Their data is stored on the public blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of these differences is vast. Let’s consider the scenario where the application is a social media app and the company wants to implement a feature that some users object to. In Web2 they have no choice but to leave the platform which also means leaving behind all the data they generated and all the friends they made on the platform. In Web3, there is no such thing as locking out the user as their data is always available on the public blockchain. If one front-end provider is charging a very high price for their app, they could use another front-end provider and still have access to all their data and their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-composability&quot;&gt;2. Composability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Web3 is built on standards and protocols, so they’re highly composable. This means that developers can treat all data sources and all projects as if it were their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the example given above, you can imagine a developer creating a different front-end that not only gets the social media posts from one platform, but could choose to include background music from the user’s song library from an entirely different platform and create an audio-visual experience altogether. This is possible because of the composability of Web3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-permissionlessness&quot;&gt;3. Permissionlessness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to develop this sort of an application on Web2, I need to get API Access from the provider, let’s say for example Twitter.  To get that access, I need to firstly submit a short essay on what I intend to do with my API access (to my own account) and then agree to terms and conditions set by Twitter’s lawyers. After this, my access remains conditional, and if I built something super popular but built something Twitter didn’t agree with or maybe felt like they would want to do themselves, they can pull my API access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s none of that on Web3. Since the data is stored on a public blockchain, it will be publicly accessible for anyone to come and write programs that can use that data without asking anyone for permission to do so and without terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-ownership-of-data&quot;&gt;4. Ownership of Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data that is typically generated by users is publicly stored, but private data is typically encrypted using the user’s public key. This means that the data can only be decrypted by the user and no one else. This puts the user’s squarely in control of their information, not any corporation. Mining this data is also impossible if it’s encrypted, so users don’t ever have to worry about being exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-pseudonymity&quot;&gt;5. Pseudonymity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a misnomer that people think that Web3 is anonymous. It is not. Every transaction on a blockchain is signed by a wallet. So all the data is identifiable as belonging to that wallet holder. The only piece of information that one doesn’t have is who the owner of the wallet is. But if anyone ever establishes that a certain wallet belongs to a specific person for example, they immediately stop being anonymous and their data becomes transparent on chain, otherwise known as getting doxxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes this is a deliberate thing, for example if a user wants social recognition in a game, they can establish their ownership of several items they have collected in their wallet, by demonstrating their ownership of that wallet. But often, users want to remain unknown and do not want to be doxxed if they can help it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-speed&quot;&gt;6. Speed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the decentralised structures, speed is often slow when compared to AWS or other such servers. This is something to keep in mind when designing systems. You have to afford for the latency as the result of actions may actually take a long time to be written to the blockchain and are not as immediate as when using equivalent systems built on Web2 standards. But all this is changing and the lines of division are being blurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-culture&quot;&gt;7. Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web3 has been built by idealists, but in a very pragmatic way in order to have real-world utility. You cannot miss hearing about the “original cypher punk” values that seem to be beneath all of it. Decentralisation is not a buzz word, it is the essence of the culture. Being authentic and original are virtues in this field. Having a different viewpoint is celebrated while corporate behaviour, censorship and authoritarianism are taboos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two biggest projects in the field Bitcoin and Ethreum. Bitcoin’s founder, is unknown, and Ethereum’s founder is Vitalik Buterin, who has actively tried to build a project that doesn’t need him to be around to succeed. He is a 29 year old billionaire who wears unicorn t-shirts and lives a nomadic lifestyle travelling the world with nothing more than what he has in his backpack. I mention these things to highlight the kind of culture that permeates through this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-digital-property&quot;&gt;8. Digital Property&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of the reason for the existence of Web3 has to do with property rights, specifically digital property rights. If you’re anything like me, all your work exists on the digital medium alone. How can you claim your ownership of a blog or artwork? With Web3, you can. You can mint it on a blockchain to claim ownership and lock in the date and time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;key-challenges-opportunities-facing-web3&quot;&gt;Key Challenges (Opportunities) Facing Web3&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Web3 to become mainstream, there are some key challenges on the user-facing side. These are also opportunities for UX designers to come in and find solutions for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-the-wallet&quot;&gt;1. The Wallet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a user wants to do anything on web3 they need a wallet. While a lot of very user-friendly wallets do exist and some even go so far as to allow Google-sign-ins to create accounts within these wallets, the purpose and usage of these wallets is not very well understood by users. This is an area that needs a lot of work as there are no direct analogies in Web2. Communicating the intricacies of public-private key cryptography is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-managing-security&quot;&gt;2. Managing Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the disadvantages of Web3 is that it only has one level of security. It’s the public private key pair and nothing else. It’s always the highest level of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike in Web2, where you signed in only with a login and password on an app of low importance, and with login, password and 2FA to your email service and possibly login, password, OTP and FaceID on a banking app, there are no other levels in Web3. You can see the problems that occur if users started using the same account for social apps as well as to store their money and there was only one level of security that exists for both and that got compromised, they end up loosing everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Web3 is pseudonymous, not anonymous, so if a user doxxed themselves on a social app, their social network could easily find out everything about their finances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in case a user forgets a password in Web2, they know they can go through some steps and regain access to their accounts. This is not the case in Web3 as there’s no recovery. If the user doesn’t do a good job storing their passwords, they may loose access to their account forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all challenges that need design intervention to solve as an industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-liquidity-fragmentation&quot;&gt;3. Liquidity Fragmentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blockchain Trilemma expresses the problem of blockchains against the dimensions of decentralisation, scalability and security and states that any blockchain can have any two of the three qualities but will need to sacrifice the third.  For this reason, there are several blockchains out there that cater to different needs with some providing security, while others are tuned for scalability. Consequently different amounts of capital are spread across these blockchains creating fragmentation of liquidity and users feel the need to constantly move their capital between these chains. But I think design could solve this problem in a number of different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-public-relations&quot;&gt;4. Public Relations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some regulators hate this field because they see it as a threat to their ability to control their population. Crypto has therefore long been portrayed as a scam by the mainstream media. The field has also had several grifters who perpetrated scams and those have also created very bad press. But just like the airline industry, each mishap has informed the field about how to improve. Web3 truly has reached a level of maturity today where it can serve mainstream use cases and make the lives of end-users a lot better. But we’ll have to overcome this PR hurdle. As a designer, you can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-the-search-for-mainstream-use-cases&quot;&gt;5. The Search for Mainstream Use Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is already a Defi use case, there are NFT’s and it is used to transfer money between people and to pay for crypto-use cases like gas fees, there are very few use cases where a mainstream user can use crypto for. There are “real world assets”, “crypto collaterals for fiat loans” and “pay with crypto” as potential ideas, but there may be many, many more. UX Designers that have worked in other fields could probably identify the application of this technology in those fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-ai-and-crypto&quot;&gt;6. AI and Crypto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No list would be complete without the mention of AI, and that’s true here too. There are very interesting applications where AI agents have been creating crypto coins and utilising it for things determined by the AI agents. But this is just the tip of the iceberg and designers would be able to identify more opportunities as this is a very creative space for it’s application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;trends-to-keep-in-mind&quot;&gt;Trends to Keep in Mind&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some trends already taking place that you should pay attention to, and change if you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-demand-for-design&quot;&gt;1. Demand for Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike any other point in time, there is a deep desire from projects to improve their design. Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum has highlighted the importance of UX in several of his talks. He is of course talking about technological improvements that would improve the user experience on the surface layer of tech. But nonetheless there is a focus on UX like no other point in time and we;’re seeing the conversation shift towards making things more usable by regular, mainstream users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-changing-demographics&quot;&gt;2. Changing Demographics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Web3 was built by engineers, for engineers, it is changing today. It is attracting far more non-technically inclined people who may be considered early-adopters. So interfaces have to cater to both audiences at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While engineers may need all the details and want to exercise control over how a transaction is performed, the early adopters tend to flock towards apps that remove the complexity and offer an opinionated (fastest transaction speeds), but simple experience. Building interfaces that cater to both may be the order of the day where interfaces can reveal more complex controls on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-changing-visual-styles&quot;&gt;3. Changing Visual Styles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, all of Web3 was specifically looking inwards and there was a strong visual identity. Colours were saturated, there were a ton of gradients, a lot of space themes, a lot of orbs, balls and atoms and felt very cutting edge. And everything was dark themed, possibly because the audience it was catering to were mainly male developers. But things have been changing. Things have grown a lot lighter now and the visual language has become a lot more accessible to the mainstream. The copy used on the websites also seem to be plain English these days and not filled with jargon and acronyms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-in-it-for-you&quot;&gt;What’s in it for you?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all that’s been said above, if you still need a reason to get into web3, here are a few:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enormous-growth-in-the-field&quot;&gt;Enormous Growth in the Field&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2024 was a great year, but 2025 is looking to be an amazing year ahead for the industry. Now is the best time to to get in, learn and contribute to this field. Imagine being able to catch the next wave of technological growth at the right time. You’ll do phenomenally well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;professional-growth&quot;&gt;Professional Growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re tired of building ecommerce portals, come over to Web3 because you’ll be working on something brand new everyday. Decentralised Finance, NFT projects, decentralised social, decentralised science, etc. these are all fields within Web3 that are being discovered everyday. If you’re interested in learning new things and staying on the bleeding edge, you should definitely consider the shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;set-standards&quot;&gt;Set Standards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several aspects that haven’t been figured out as yet. If you’re anything like me, you enjoy working in the unknown and figuring out and building standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, a project called Uniswap presented a very simple interface for swapping tokens and that’s become the de-facto standard interface that is being used anywhere tokens are swapped. Or take the way Metamask did on-boarding, that’s become the standard for all wallets today. In the same way there are a ton of other aspects of Web3 that are still being figured out and you could be there contributing new ideas into the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-it-for-the-money&quot;&gt;Do it for the money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, do it because the money is good. Web3 projects typically pay very well because there aren’t a lot of designers who understand it. But that’s not all. Contributors are typically also given project tokens as part of the compensation in place of ESOPS. While some ESOPS go up by 20% if you’re lucky, tokens on the other hand can sometime go up by 20X, so in case of an upside, the values could be life-changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as AI transformed from a sci-fi concept to an everyday reality, Web3 is following a similar trajectory. We’re already seeing traditional companies like MicroStrategy transform its business by simply holding Bitcoin, growing its market value from $1.1 billion in 2020 to over $8 billion in 2021. And that’s just from using cryptocurrency as a treasury asset. You can imagine the potential when companies fully embrace Web3’s capabilities: decentralised operations, user-owned data, and transparent transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a UX designer in Web3, you’re not just designing interfaces – you’re designing the future of digital interactions. The challenges are significant, but so are the opportunities. Start small, focus on user needs, and don’t be afraid to challenge conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, every great interface began with someone asking, “Couldn’t this be simpler?” That’s your mission in Web3. The technology is ready; now it’s time to make it human.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Ultimate Guide to Hiring the Right UX Design Agency</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It doesn’t matter that the design agency has a high rating if they aren’t a good fit for your project. But how do you find the right one?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-the-right-ux-design-agency-for-your-project&quot;&gt;The Ultimate Guide to Hiring the Right UX Design Agency for your Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I used to run my UX design agency, we had a lot of clients that came to us after already having worked with another agency for the same project. Upon enquiring as to the reason for them to switch to us, we often were told some version of “The other team just didn’t get what we wanted”. The vain side of me would have been pleased, and I often was in the beginning, until I learnt that these situations weren’t only caused by mistakes made by the vendors, but also by the businesses that hired them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a business that’s interested in hiring a UX design agency, read this article to avoid paying twice for the same thing and learn to hire the right agency for your project the first time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;understanding-ux-design&quot;&gt;Understanding UX Design&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sure-fire way to hire the wrong agency is to not understand what UX design can do for you. Design, unlike art, is about solving problems. The job of a UX designer is to develop a solution to the business problem that you articulate. They translate the business objective that you set, into the form of an application that will help achieve that goal. They do this while balancing the needs of the customers against the business interests while working within limitations posed by technology and also by your company’s brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t a simple task but I hope you can see that it takes a special blend of someone that is business oriented, technically adept, artistically inclined, detail-oriented as well as sensitive to culture to do this job right. A good design agency will be a partner in helping you achieve your goals, not someone who will spit out something pretty to slap onto your website and call it a day. You on the other hand, should be figuring out the right way to engage with such a person or a team and demanding the right kind of output from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, typically people hire UX designers to do one of the following: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have an idea for solving a certain business problem with software and you want to develop a prototype in order to further refine that idea and bring it into a form that is more real than just an idea. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want to reduce the overall costs of software production by working out all the kinks and details on paper as it were, before handing it off to a developer to build out — the “measure twice and cut once” approach.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need to bring all the disparate ideas of a bunch of stakeholders from across your organisation and put it into a cohesive form of a software application.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want to build a prototype and build consensus across all the major stakeholders within your organisation before allocating budgets and building it out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want to get the product designed in order to plan out the efforts and expenses required in order to get this product built. It will also help you decide what the budget allocations need to be.
    &lt;h1 id=&quot;preparing-a-brief&quot;&gt;Preparing a Brief&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted above, it is imperative to the success of the project that you take the time to define your business objectives clearly. Try being as specific as possible, by describing things like, “We have had most of our customers purchasing items from within a single vertical, but in an ideal world, every user landing on the website would generate a cart value of $2,000 with products from across three different product verticals”, or, “Our customer service division has some of the highest churn rates and this makes it difficult to impart the brand values of our company onto new hires so that they can interact with customers in line with the way we do things here”, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless it is critical for some reason, do not make the mistake of specifying &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; this should be done too early on. For example, don’t say, you need a website, an iOS app, etc. to do these things. It’s the design team’s job is to figure out the “how” of it all. Even if they will eventually land at the point of developing a website, etc. they sometimes may surprise you by solving the problem in another way that you may not have anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the interactions that I remember fondly was with this client who was patiently listening to my team’s pitch as to the right solution to the problem he had stated previously. When one of his employees started to correct me about the mental model that I had used for designing the application, the boss, knowing fully well why he had hired us, politely interjected and asked the employee to allow me to finish. In the end, they were pleasantly surprised that we had removed an unnecessary layer while still achieving their objective. This wouldn’t have been possible if they had been hyper prescriptive about the solution they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;finding-potential-agencies&quot;&gt;Finding Potential Agencies&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the best method of finding a UX design agency is through a referral of someone that has worked with the agency because you’d also understand the fit, searching online and finding them on lists such as Clutch may be inevitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-rankings&quot;&gt;a. Rankings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that the rankings are not always completely objective. Their methods of evaluation aren’t so granular that you can reliably pass a judgement that someone ranked 20 is definitely better than someone ranked 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were ranked among the top 20 within India and 100 in the global ranking, I really would pay more attention to whether the agency is a good fit for you, which is the most important thing. Still, these lists are undeniably a great resource to rely upon while looking for design partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;b-local-vs-remote&quot;&gt;b. Local vs. Remote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design agencies can work remotely, but, I’d give the one that can come into your office a few times a greater preference score than an agency that absolutely cannot. There are specific stages, like discovery discussions, brainstorming, user testing, pitching ideas that could benefit from being done in person. So if the agency you are looking for can come into your office for these meetings specifically, it would be great, but if that’s not at all possible, it’s should not be a deal-breaker in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;c-industry-experience&quot;&gt;c. Industry Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your project has to do with improving an existing system of some kind, then industry expertise may help as you’d probably spend less time in explaining some fundamental ideas to the designers. But if you’re breaking new ground, I’d give less importance to the designers having the industry experience because most designers will learn the intricacies of the industry anyway, but also because designers that are new to a field may evaluate it with fresh eyes and see things in a different way which may be exactly what the doctor ordered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;d-alignment-of-values&quot;&gt;d. Alignment of Values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a subjective aspect to design and that’s to do with taste. Some design agencies are drawn to flash while others are drawn to quiet efficiency. Some designers may take short-cuts to solving problems quickly while others take the long but reliable paths. In all these areas, taste matters. Don’t make the mistake of hiring a designer that clearly shows you one quality in all their work and expect that they will deliver on another quality that you want. You are never going to be able to demand every little be made a certain way. Engaging an agency inherently means that you are relying on them to make several micro-decisions on your behalf. So engage wit the agency that resonates with you so that you are going to be comfortable with these choices that they will make on your behalf. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Important Side Note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Do not evaluate design portfolio’s solely based on visual design expertise, unless that’s the requirement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;filtration&quot;&gt;Filtration&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so you’ve succeeded in short-listing a few design agencies that you want to work with. Now you’ve got to figure out which one of these is the right fit for you. The filtration process should help you find someone that is technically proficient, someone that has not portrayed themselves as something more than they are, someone who fits your culture and finally fits your budget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, you could begin by requesting a proposal from each of the agencies. You can call these agencies up and have a brief discussion with them on the phone. They may request a brief from you which you can send out to them. How long they take to send out a proposal to you would itself indicate whether they have their internal processes figured out or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get the proposal, that itself becomes a good device to evaluate the capability of the agency. You see, if they are good UX designers, they would make this process easy for you right from the get go. Their proposal will clearly spell out what is involved in the process, give you firm estimates of time and costs and also detail out the payment schedules. It would have been designed to answer all the questions in your mind about engaging the agency. If it does not, this is a sign of immaturity and likely a strike against the agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post this, typically the agency may request a time slot to walk through the proposal with you. You could also request the same if they don’t offer one. In this call, make sure to cover the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you evaluate the success of your design?&lt;br /&gt;
 Design is a solution to a problem, and UX design is usually employed to solve business problems. The work that UX designers do there are not subjective but instead very clear solutions to business problems. If the design isn’t helping achieve that business goal, then the design isn’t successful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you done any work in my field? If not, what would your approach be in the design of our application?
 If they have worked in the same field, you’d be able to evaluate things on an apples-to-apples basis, but if they haven’t, you’ll understand how they’d approach learning about the field first and then solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What has been the effect of your application design? Is there data to substantiate the success?&lt;br /&gt;
 While the external design agency may not always have access to the data and analytics that emanated from their design work, this question will still let you assess whether the designer understand that their work is always based on a hypothesis and always an experiment that needs to be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What has been the biggest reasons for delays in your past projects?
 This question evaluates whether they’ve seen delays in past projects. There definitely will be a few where delays have occurred, and this is quite natural in endeavours that have a lot of interdependencies between clients and vendor teams. So the point is to probe whether they’ve understood what causes a lot of delays in projects and what steps they’ve taken to improve the process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you determined issues with your design and fixed them after the initial design was delivered?
 This goes back to the point about what designers think about their work. No matter how much research is done ahead of time, every project is based on several assumptions from the clients and from the designers, they are all based on a hypothetical understanding. The truth can only be learnt by putting the design in the hands of users and evaluated at that time. There will be things learnt that will reinforce our assumptions, but there will also be things that we will learn that could be improved. There is never a situation where everything is perfect. In reality, the designer may never have information on how things performed because the client may never share such information with external vendors. But the question is meant to probe whether designers understand the temporal nature of their work and what they do to improve their understanding and provide better solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;red-flags&quot;&gt;Red Flags&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An architect friend once mentioned this idea of inspection points. They said that if you want to examine the quality of construction of a building, you don’t need to go floor by floor and examine the beams, you can just go to the basement and look at the pillars there. If there’s any major faults in construction, the first place the weaknesses will show up will be on these pillars. In that same spirit, the following are some things that will indicate the quality of the agency that you’re working with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-acronym-overdose&quot;&gt;1. Acronym Overdose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acronyms are useful to express some ideas a little more efficiently. But it’s overuse stems from ineptitude or from a desire to hide behind them to hide a lack of knowledge. In any case, the job of a UX designer is to be understood, not to obfuscate. So if they’re not demonstrating an ability to speak to you, their potential clients, in a way that you can understand, they definitely will not be able to help you communicate any better with your end-users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-disinterest&quot;&gt;2. Disinterest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a designer to really help you succeed, it is imperative that they understand your true motivation behind working on this project. A good designer will definitely probe to find out this answer. If any of these designers haven’t bothered to do this, they will definitely not be delivering anything great for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-absolute-certainty&quot;&gt;3. Absolute Certainty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how much experience an agency has, all design work is based on a hypothetical understanding of what the problem is and the design itself is a best-guess estimate of the solution. This is because the number of variables change from project to project including end-users. So be vary of the agency that states with absolute certainty that they have the right solution. They are more likely to make mistakes than those that approach the project with humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-financial-discipline&quot;&gt;4. Financial Discipline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a designer doesn’t convey their payment schedules in their proposal, they are inexperienced and don’t have enough of an understanding of the impact of finances on the execution of a project. There have been agencies that have had to stop working on their client projects midway. This is clearly a result of the agency not understanding their processes well enough and knowing how much money they will burn while working on your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;budget-considerations&quot;&gt;Budget Considerations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you’ve not previously estimated how much you should spend for UX design, you would now have a great idea of how much it would cost based on the proposals that you would have received from the agencies that you reached out to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I understand that a lot of businesses are perplexed by the idea of paying too much for something and they want to know what the “fair market value” is. I find the idea absurd as this is not a commodity where you can substitute one designer’s output with another’s. If you find a designer whose output you like, then the “fair market value” is whatever they want to charge you then, isn’t it? But then this argument may fall on deaf ears and sound less “rational” to some, so in an effort to provide a rational answer, you could do the following exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, find out how much it would cost to employ a UX designer with about 2 years of experience on a full-time basis in your area. Divide that by 12 to get their monthly salary. Then, multiply that by 5 as a project typically requires the efforts of 4 people with varying levels of experience on a non-100% utilisation basis. That number is what you should expect to pay on a minimum (not maximum) for each month of engagement with any agency. There is no maximum that you can pay as the sky’s the limit. There are premiums you could add onto this for star designers on the teams or if the agency can bring additional skills to table, like motion design, film production, over an above the base level UX design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your company is cost conscious and wants to find a way to reduce the costs, you could try to work across geographies. Vietnam, India and Ukraine have some great English speaking UX design agencies that can provide you a lot of value for up to 40% less than what it would cost you in the US or Western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Important Side Note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The idea that you could hire four designers only for a few months and have them pull off a great output is absurd. A few of my clients at my agency have been those that have tried to do this and failed and then decided to hire an agency after all. They typically spent 1.5 to 2 times what it should have cost them in the first place, so keep that in mind.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;reviewing-agreements-and-contracts&quot;&gt;Reviewing Agreements and Contracts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite often large companies have standard boiler-plate engagement contracts for service providers, but in case you don’t you could request the engagement contract from your agency. Very often, if the proposal is detailed enough, that itself could be used to sign and formalise the engagement with the agency as it would contain all the usual terms that are covered in legal contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are very few “gotcha’s” to look out for, here are some key clauses that you want to examine before you sign the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-scope&quot;&gt;1. Scope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please make sure that all that you intend to cover in this project is covered in the scope section. Despite any conversations that you may have had, the engagement will only be decided based on what’s covered in the scope section.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-delivery-formats&quot;&gt;2. Delivery Formats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For UX design, the output is typically required by development teams, so make sure that they are receiving the following to make sure that your &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-fixed-costs&quot;&gt;3. Fixed Costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please make sure that you are working with the agency on a fixed-cost basis. They may ask you to pay on an hourly-basis for additional work, but whatever is covered within the scope should be delivered within the costs specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-ownership-of-intellectual-property&quot;&gt;4. Ownership of Intellectual Property&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most agencies will be on a “work-for-hire” contract basis, be sure to clarify that all intellectual property developed through this project will belong to your company. This will help you use the output of the project to your benefit and further development in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-non-disclosure-agreement&quot;&gt;5. Non-Disclosure Agreement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be several things that you discuss about your business in order for the agency to design their application. Make sure that the agency cannot disclose this information about your organisation without your permission. Having this agreement in place will also allow your team members to speak openly and freely with the designers allowing them to develop applications that more accurately serve your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-support&quot;&gt;6. Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every design agency will need to provide support post the delivery of their work. Documentation will only go so far and some live support will be required once in a while to explain some intricacies of the design. Make sure that the contract includes a support period post delivery and also a method to seek support well after that as that is required sometimes. Get this for remote support as well as for in-person support if that’s an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;freelancers-vs-agencies&quot;&gt;Freelancers vs. Agencies&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must speak a little about hiring freelancers as that’s often an alternative that’s considered by businesses often. As I’ve been a freelancer before building an agency, I think I am in a good position to answer this and also argue for one over the other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my considered opinion that businesses should only hire freelancers in very specific situations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The project is very cost sensitive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The project is a one-off and does not have long term impact&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You already have done enough research to guide the designer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are okay with delays&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are comfortable with the skills that are being provided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all other situations, there is absolutely no reason to hire freelancers, because with a freelancer, you get the wisdom of just one person. Design requires a lot of debate, and that’s hard to achieve as an individual, not impossible, but hard. Their learnings may also be limited as they typically are employed only on small and short term projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen cases where the freelancers don’t show up to meetings, they have ended projects without notice, or have behaved in unprofessional ways. Clients have thereafter had to find ways to scramble and recover from these setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for these reasons, I suggest working with teams where these problems are usually not prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine sells bicycles and I went to him when I wanted to get into the sport. When I asked him to recommend a bike, he showed me something that was well over the amount that I had anticipated paying for a bike. So I said that since I was just getting into riding bikes, I wanted to get one that wasn’t so expensive and then if I like the sport, I would buy something more expensive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he said in response remains with me till today because it is extremely relevant to my field. He said that if I was serious about getting into the field, I should be getting the best bike I can afford, because buying the wrong bike will actually make me hate the sport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I relate this story because it’s a great metaphor for choosing the right agency. If you make the wrong choice of agency and develop the wrong app based on their work, you may end up attributing the failure of the app to the weakness of the idea behind it. You may even end up making the wrong business decision whereas you may have come to a very different conclusion if you had just made a better decision while choosing the right agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I hope this article is useful to you in making the right choice. But if you need any help, do reach out to me once you’ve shortlisted your agencies, and I’d be happy to help you make the final choice!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Design Proposals that Boost Conversion Rates</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building proposal templates takes a lot of effort and you’re still left unsure of whether you’ve done it right. This article tries to help you fix that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;creating-a-winning-ux-design-proposal-a-comprehensive-guide&quot;&gt;Creating a Winning UX Design Proposal: A Comprehensive Guide&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crafting a UX design proposal can be challenging, but it is also an invaluable tool in securing new projects and demonstrating professionalism. A well-structured proposal not only showcases your understanding of the client’s needs but also reflects your agency’s strengths and your ability to foresee potential project challenges. Based on my years running a UX design agency, here’s a guide to creating a compelling proposal that can boost your conversion rates and help you stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-understanding-the-purpose-of-a-proposal&quot;&gt;1. Understanding the Purpose of a Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proposal is essentially the answer to the client’s questions before they commit to hiring you. They want to know if you understand their project, if you’re aligned on goals, and if your capabilities and deliverables match their expectations. Answering these questions clearly within your proposal gives clients the confidence they need to move forward with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-key-components-of-a-ux-proposal&quot;&gt;2. Key Components of a UX Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make your proposal thorough and professional, include these eight essential components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-summary&quot;&gt;Project Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary should ensure everyone is on the same page. Here, outline the specific project objectives, emphasising the agreed-upon approach. If your agency has unique strengths, such as a technical or development background, this is the place to highlight them. This section serves as a commitment to the client, defining exactly what you’ll focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feature-list&quot;&gt;Feature List&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most time-intensive sections, the feature list outlines the project at a high level, covering major elements without getting overly technical. For instance, if the project includes user authentication, mention this as a feature but avoid specific technical details like whether it will include OTP verification. This list demonstrates thorough planning, showing that you’re not just sending a generic proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scope-of-work&quot;&gt;Scope of Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline all the deliverables you’ll provide. This section can also serve as a showcase for your agency’s full capabilities, even if some services aren’t part of this specific project. For example, list everything from wireframing to prototyping, and clarify which tools and formats you’ll use. Ensuring clarity on deliverables avoids confusion later on and establishes a sense of professionalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;team-structure&quot;&gt;Team Structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explain who will be working on the project, their roles, and their experience levels. This can include a project manager, UX/UI designers, and other support roles like content creators or icon designers. Detailing your team structure justifies your pricing, showing the client that the work involves skilled professionals rather than being handled solely by a generalist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engagement-guidelines&quot;&gt;Engagement Guidelines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set out expectations on both sides. Define a single point of contact (Spock) on your team and request the same on the client’s end to streamline communication. Specify a regular meeting cadence, like weekly check-ins, to keep the project on track. This section also covers managing scope changes and clarifies your availability to avoid client requests at odd hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;support&quot;&gt;Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support goes beyond project completion, as clients may need assistance once the design phase is over. Typically, offer 30 days of support post-handover to handle clarifications and minor adjustments, but make it clear that extensive support beyond this window will incur additional charges. This also includes defining the method of support, whether remote or on-site, with associated travel costs if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cost-and-packages&quot;&gt;Cost and Packages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costing can be a make-or-break aspect of your proposal. Offering tiered packages—bare minimum, standard, and premium—can appeal to different budgets and give clients flexibility. Using a worksheet to customise package features and pricing quickly allows you to respond to client requests efficiently, showing professionalism and organisational readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;payment-schedule-and-protection-clauses&quot;&gt;Payment Schedule and Protection Clauses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing a payment schedule is essential for cash flow and client commitment. A common approach is 50% upfront, 25% midway, and the remaining 25% upon completion. Clearly state conditions for payment delays, such as the right to halt or terminate the project if payments are not made on time. Including protection clauses safeguards your interests, and clients typically view them as standard business practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;additional-annexures&quot;&gt;Additional Annexures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, append any extra information that can strengthen your proposal, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: Highlight your agency’s expertise and how you stand out. Large clients, especially, may appreciate a quick reference on your background without needing to research separately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Client Portfolio&lt;/strong&gt;: Showcasing similar past projects builds credibility. If your client seeks an e-commerce solution, for example, list other e-commerce projects you’ve completed to demonstrate your experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Bios (Optional)&lt;/strong&gt;: If certain team members have notable expertise, add brief bios. This personal touch can reinforce the unique value you bring to the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-recognising-common-proposal-traps&quot;&gt;3. Recognising Common Proposal Traps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all proposal requests are genuine. Some clients may seek proposals simply to benchmark costs, fulfil internal bidding quotas, or collect ideas without intending to hire. Though you can’t always avoid such situations, by treating ideas as renewable and presenting your unique perspective, you position yourself as a resourceful, innovative partner for potential clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-automating-for-efficiency-to-an-extent&quot;&gt;4. Automating for Efficiency (to an Extent)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automating repetitive proposal elements, like feature lists or pricing structures, can streamline your process. However, automation shouldn’t replace human interaction altogether. Proposals play a vital role in assessing potential clients and understanding their unique needs, so a fully automated system risks undermining this relationship-building opportunity. I chose to keep personal contact integral to my process, which allowed me to enjoy a diverse range of projects with clients I valued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-crafted UX design proposal is more than a sales document; it’s an opportunity to build trust and set clear expectations with clients. By including comprehensive components, adapting to different client needs, and presenting a strong sense of your agency’s capabilities, your proposal can serve as a valuable tool for both winning projects and ensuring smooth collaboration throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this framework, I hope you’ll find the proposal process smoother, more efficient, and ultimately more successful.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Designing Web3 Wallets for Mainstream Users</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a problem with Web3 wallets, they’re just too complex. But where’s the problem stemming from and how do we solve it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;web3-wallets-for-mainstream-users&quot;&gt;Web3 Wallets for Mainstream Users&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web3, the next phase of the internet powered by blockchain technology, promises to revolutionise industries, but its complexity continues to alienate mainstream users. At the heart of this challenge is the Web3 wallet—a fundamental tool required for engaging with decentralised applications (dApps), managing cryptocurrencies, and accessing blockchain networks. While Web3 enthusiasts have embraced the wallet system, its cryptographic foundations and technical jargon have left everyday users overwhelmed and frustrated. To drive mainstream adoption of Web3, we need to focus on fixing the wallet experience, making it intuitive and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we’ll explore why the wallet is the crux of Web3 usability challenges and how a thoughtful redesign grounded in familiar concepts, like banking, can unlock its full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-wallet-conundrum-complexity-meets-confusion&quot;&gt;The Wallet Conundrum: Complexity Meets Confusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary function of a Web3 wallet is to store a user’s private and public keys. These cryptographic keys are used to authorise transactions and prove the user’s identity within the blockchain ecosystem. But this process, while secure and revolutionary, is incredibly foreign to non-technical users. Terms like “private key,” “public key,” and “signing messages” can cause even the most tech-savvy Web2 users to shy away. The need for simplification is apparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Web2, users can easily send and receive money through banks or payment apps without ever having to understand the mechanics behind these systems. Web3, by contrast, demands users grasp cryptographic principles or risk losing access to their digital assets. The complexity isn’t just a barrier; it’s a deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many existing wallets, such as Zerion or Rabby, have attempted to ease the user experience by iterating on older designs. And while they have indeed made Web3 more user-friendly, they still fall short of the mainstream appeal necessary for broad adoption. These wallets are excellent by Web3 standards, but they remain inscrutable for the average Web2 user, leaving us to ask: Why can’t a Web3 wallet be as intuitive as the apps we’re already accustomed to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;terminology-matters-the-language-of-web3&quot;&gt;Terminology Matters: The Language of Web3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant part of the problem lies in the terminology itself. In Web3, terms like “wallet” are used inaccurately. In traditional banking, a wallet implies a place where you store something—cash, cards, and other financial instruments. However, in Web3, a wallet doesn’t “store” money in the traditional sense. Instead, it acts more like an access card to funds stored on the blockchain. Misleading terminology adds to the confusion, making it harder for users to understand how to manage their digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source development, which is central to the Web3 ecosystem, has contributed to this confusion. Over time, various developers have used different terms to describe the same concepts, leading to inconsistent vocabulary across platforms. For instance, “public key,” “wallet address,” and “externally owned account” all refer to the same thing, but new users won’t know that. This inconsistency hinders their ability to trust and navigate the system confidently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language is powerful, and when users encounter familiar terms, they can better grasp unfamiliar concepts. Web2 sites like e-commerce platforms utilise relatable language (“add to cart,” “checkout”) that immediately makes sense to users. The same approach needs to be applied to Web3 wallets if we want to make them accessible to the average person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-familiarity-banking-as-a-metaphor&quot;&gt;Building Familiarity: Banking as a Metaphor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve the wallet problem, we need to rethink the entire framework. Instead of framing wallets with cryptographic jargon, we should use a metaphor that resonates with mainstream users. And what’s more familiar than banking? Banking is a 2,000-year-old institution, and most people are already acquainted with its core concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By reimagining the Web3 wallet as a piece of “banking software,” we can translate complex blockchain concepts into terms users already understand. For instance, the wallet itself could be referred to as “banking software,” the wallet address as an “account number,” the private key as a “signature,” blockchain networks as “networks,” and the various fees associated with a transaction such as “tip”, “gas” and such could be simplified into “transaction fees,” just as people are used to paying on traditional payment platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This banking analogy would not only make Web3 wallets more relatable but also help ease users into the system without overwhelming them with technical details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-three-account-structure-enhancing-security-and-usability&quot;&gt;A Three-Account Structure: Enhancing Security and Usability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to simplifying the terminology, a redesigned Web3 wallet should also mimic the structure of traditional banking. A banking app typically offers various types of accounts—checking, savings, and investment—and the same can be applied to Web3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checking Account&lt;/strong&gt;: This would be where users conduct everyday transactions with known entities or individuals, similar to a checking account in traditional banking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savings Account&lt;/strong&gt;: This would serve as a secure place to store assets, where users could stake cryptocurrencies or simply keep them safe. It would allow users to generate interest on their holdings without needing to interact with external applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment Account&lt;/strong&gt;: For users seeking higher risk and reward opportunities, this account would enable interaction with decentralised applications (dApps) for staking, lending, or other investment activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This compartmentalisation not only makes the system more intuitive but also enhances security. By limiting the interactions of the checking and savings accounts with external applications, users can reduce their exposure to potential security risks. Only the investment account, which is meant for higher-risk activities, would be open to external dApps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-road-ahead-evolving-web3-for-the-mainstream&quot;&gt;The Road Ahead: Evolving Web3 for the Mainstream&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the wallet is the linchpin of Web3 adoption. If we can make the wallet experience seamless and intuitive, we can unlock Web3’s immense potential for a wider audience. The key lies in rethinking both the terminology and structure, using familiar banking concepts to demystify the process. By addressing these foundational issues, we can bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, paving the way for mass adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For designers and developers working on Web3 applications, this means prioritising usability over technical prowess. It means considering what mainstream users already know and building upon that knowledge, rather than introducing new, foreign concepts. The future of Web3 is bright, but only if we can make it accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five personal AI assistant devices reviewed and what they need to fix</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The world of AI assistants has taken a sharp leap forward with new devices emerging every year. However, despite the excitement around these personal AI assistant devices, many haven’t lived up to their full potential. Having headed a UX design agency ranked among the top 100 globally, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges and nuances of designing new tech. Today, I want to share with you seven critical mistakes these products are making—and how I believe we can fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-arent-personal-ai-assistants-taking-off&quot;&gt;Why Aren’t Personal AI Assistants Taking Off?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the nitty-gritty, let’s get one thing clear. The personal AI assistants I’m referring to aren’t like Siri or Google Assistant on your phone. We’re talking about devices that can break down complex tasks and execute them for you—whether it’s running apps, searching the web, or even coding in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These devices are mostly aimed at early adopters right now, but the goal is to create something for everyone. If you picture the product adoption lifecycle, we’re still in the early adopter phase. Right now, companies are testing their products in different niches, trying to figure out what sticks. It’s a chaotic phase, and we’re seeing an explosion of ideas—some good, some not so much. A lot of these ideas won’t make it to the mainstream, but that’s what makes this phase so exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s dig into the seven mistakes these AI assistant products are making and how I think they can course-correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-not-using-the-right-metaphor&quot;&gt;1. Not Using the Right Metaphor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first mistake is starting with the wrong metaphor. Products need to fit into a framework that users already understand. People don’t like adopting something completely alien. I always say evolution trumps revolution, especially in mass-market products. Finding a metaphor that connects the new with the familiar is crucial. AI assistants should be positioned as an evolution of tools people already know, not a radical shift that alienates potential users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-limited-accessibility-and-reachability&quot;&gt;2. Limited Accessibility and Reachability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an AI assistant to succeed, it needs to be extremely accessible. Think about the evolution of computing—from desktops to laptops, tablets, smartphones, and now wearables. The goal is to bring tech closer to the user. Personal AI devices need to occupy that space between a smartphone and the user—something wearable that’s always available at a moment’s notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users are going to need to learn a new behaviour—one where they think in terms of goals, not apps. The easier we make it for them to access the assistant, the quicker they’ll adapt. ^1c44a7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-lack-of-multimodal-inputs-and-outputs&quot;&gt;3. Lack of Multimodal Inputs and Outputs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest—audio alone isn’t enough. Yes, voice commands are intuitive and efficient for certain tasks, but information needs to be delivered in various ways. Visual feedback, like images and text, allows users to process information faster. Devices that rely only on voice, like some AI pins or pendants, miss out on the efficiency that visual data provides. The solution is to design devices with both visual and auditory outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-poor-data-privacy-protections&quot;&gt;4. Poor Data Privacy Protections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With AI, the question of privacy becomes even more critical. These devices will have access to mountains of personal data, and without strong privacy protections, they could easily become surveillance tools. The safest way to ensure privacy? Keep the data on the device itself. I think open-source projects like Open Interpreter, which runs locally on the user’s device, are on the right track. This model protects privacy and offers immediate feedback—something that cloud-based models struggle with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-lag-in-response-time&quot;&gt;5. Lag in Response Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For AI assistants to feel natural, they need to respond quickly. Research shows that interactions that take longer than 400 milliseconds feel slow and clunky. Devices relying on cloud-based AI models are always going to have some lag, no matter how fast the server is. To hit that magical threshold of 400 milliseconds, AI models need to run locally on the device. Otherwise, users will experience delays that break the flow of interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-lack-of-interoperability&quot;&gt;6. Lack of Interoperability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re transitioning to a new kind of computing—one where AI agents handle tasks for us. These agents need to be able to interact seamlessly with existing systems and applications. If a user wants their AI assistant to book an Uber or play a song on Spotify, the interaction needs to be flawless. Devices that struggle with this will quickly fall out of favour. The future belongs to AI assistants that can bridge both the current and future computing models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-failure-to-create-universal-interfaces&quot;&gt;7. Failure to Create Universal Interfaces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final mistake I see is the lack of universal, adaptable interfaces. Every request a user makes might require a different interface—one that adapts in real-time. If I ask my AI assistant to book an Uber, the interface might display a map. If I want to pick between two songs, I’ll need a list. These interfaces need to be generated on the fly, based on the user’s specific request. A rigid interface simply won’t cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-of-ai-assistants&quot;&gt;The Future of AI Assistants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the best form factor for personal AI assistants is a wearable device—specifically a smartwatch. It’s close to the user, easy to access, and can incorporate the necessary screen for visual feedback. While today’s smartwatches may not have the power to run advanced AI models, the tech is catching up. With chip technology becoming more efficient and AI models getting smaller, we’re not far from a future where AI-powered smartwatches will be the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, while none of the current products on the market have quite nailed it yet, some are closer than others. But in the end, it’s the big players—Google, Microsoft, and Meta—that are best positioned to dominate the personal AI assistant space. They have the data, and in AI, data is king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I root for the underdog, I wouldn’t bet my money on any of the current startups trying to break into this space. The race will be won by those with the resources to gather and process the vast amounts of data required to create truly effective AI assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
