        <title>How to hire the right design agency for your project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It doesn’t matter that the design agency has a high rating if they aren’t a good fit for your project. But how do you find the right one?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-the-right-ux-design-agency-for-your-project&quot;&gt;The Ultimate Guide to Hiring the Right UX Design Agency for your Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s tech-driven world, user experience (UX) design plays a pivotal role in shaping how users interact with your brand. Whether you’re building a new software application, improving an existing platform, or creating a product prototype, good UX design can help streamline user interactions and drive business success. However, hiring the right UX design agency or freelancer can be a daunting process for businesses unfamiliar with the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many options available, it can be difficult to determine which UX professionals are best suited to meet your needs. Do you go with an agency or hire a freelancer? How do you assess their skills, portfolios, and past work? What questions should you ask to ensure you’re making the right choice? This guide aims to answer these questions and more, offering you a comprehensive roadmap for hiring the right UX design talent for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-start-with-defining-your-objective&quot;&gt;1. Start with Defining Your Objective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in hiring the right UX designer is to clearly define your objectives. What are you trying to achieve with your UX design project? Having a solid understanding of your goals will help you narrow down your choices and ensure the designer or agency you hire is the best fit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common reasons for hiring UX designers include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing a Prototype:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a new idea for a product or feature and need a prototype to visualise the concept and test its feasibility.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; You want to reduce development costs by sorting out design issues upfront, before starting actual development. This “measure twice, cut once” approach helps you avoid costly mistakes later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Consensus Among Stakeholders:&lt;/strong&gt; You may need to bring together multiple stakeholders and create a cohesive design to align the team and secure budget approval.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing the Product:&lt;/strong&gt; Creating a design will help define the project’s scope and budget, allowing for better planning of resources and timelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By identifying your specific objective, you can better match the right designer or agency to the project. Different objectives may require different skill sets, and a clear goal will also help streamline the design process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-essential-qualities-of-a-good-ux-designer-or-agency&quot;&gt;2. Essential Qualities of a Good UX Designer or Agency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have defined your goals, it’s time to look at the qualities that make a great UX designer or agency. Whether you’re considering an individual freelancer or a full-service agency, certain attributes should always be present:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear Process Understanding:&lt;/strong&gt; A good UX designer should have a defined process and be able to articulate it clearly. Whether it’s a particular framework or set of methodologies (e.g., Design Thinking, Agile UX), they should be able to walk you through how they approach a project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Estimates:&lt;/strong&gt; They should be able to provide reasonable estimates for project duration, costs, and resources required, even if they are preliminary.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Understanding:&lt;/strong&gt; UX design is not only about aesthetics but also about how designs fit into the broader technological ecosystem. Your designer should understand how the design impacts system functionality, which is especially important when working with complex software.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialisation and Expertise:&lt;/strong&gt; The ideal design team will have specialised roles. For instance, one person may handle design, while another focuses on development, and someone else may manage user research. This specialisation helps ensure a high standard of work across the project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; An agency or freelancer with significant experience will be better equipped to handle challenges and unforeseen problems that arise during the project. Experience doesn’t necessarily mean years in business but rather the volume and diversity of projects handled successfully.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear Communication:&lt;/strong&gt; They should have defined schedules for meetings, feedback, and payments, allowing you to track progress and stay on the same page throughout the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the designer or agency meets these criteria, you’re likely dealing with a professional team that knows how to deliver quality work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-red-flags-to-watch-out-for&quot;&gt;3. Red Flags to Watch Out For&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as important as recognising the qualities of a good designer is being able to spot red flags that indicate the wrong fit. Here are some common signs to watch out for when vetting potential UX partners:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overuse of Jargon: If a designer uses too much industry-specific jargon or technical terms that aren’t explained clearly, they may be trying to impress you with buzzwords instead of providing clear answers. UX design should be about simplifying experiences, so if they can’t explain their approach in plain language, they may not be the right fit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of Interest in Your Objectives: If a designer doesn’t ask about your business goals or the specific problem you’re trying to solve, that’s a red flag. A good UX designer needs to understand your objectives to deliver a design that aligns with them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No Clear Payment Schedules: Designers or agencies that are vague about their payment terms or don’t discuss budgets upfront may lack professionalism or financial stability. Transparent payment terms are a hallmark of reliable partners.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overpromising Results: Beware of agencies or freelancers who promise perfection or unrealistic timelines without acknowledging the iterative nature of design. UX design is inherently based on user testing, feedback, and improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotting these red flags early can save your business from costly mistakes and delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-reviewing-portfolios-what-to-look-for&quot;&gt;4. Reviewing Portfolios: What to Look For&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A designer’s portfolio is one of the most critical factors in evaluating their expertise. Here’s how to assess it effectively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relevance to Your Industry or Goals:&lt;/strong&gt; While industry-specific experience can be valuable, don’t dismiss candidates who haven’t worked in your field. Fresh perspectives can often lead to innovative solutions. However, ensure they demonstrate the ability to research and adapt to new industries.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus Areas:&lt;/strong&gt; Portfolios often reveal a designer’s strengths. For instance, some focus on visually stunning designs, while others excel in functionality and efficiency. Choose a designer whose style aligns with your project’s priorities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual vs. Functional Strengths:&lt;/strong&gt; Portfolios reveal whether a designer focuses more on aesthetic appeal or functional efficiency. If your project requires a highly efficient user flow, prioritize functional strength. For consumer-facing apps, visual appeal may take precedence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversity of Projects:&lt;/strong&gt; A strong portfolio showcases a variety of projects, from simple interfaces to complex systems. This indicates the designer’s ability to adapt to different challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay attention not just to the final designs but also to the thought process and problem-solving approaches behind each project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-key-questions-to-ask-potential-designers&quot;&gt;5. Key Questions to Ask Potential Designers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During consultations, ask targeted questions to assess their expertise and working style. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you evaluate the success of your designs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  A strong designer will focus on measurable outcomes tied to your business goals, like increased conversions or reduced user errors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you worked in my industry? If not, how would you approach learning about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  This question helps you assess how well they can adapt to new challenges and conduct necessary research.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What challenges have you faced in past projects, and how did you overcome them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Understanding how they handle setbacks can give you insight into their problem-solving skills.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has been the impact of your designs? Do you have data to support their success?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Even if a designer doesn’t always have access to the full metrics from past projects, this question helps assess their understanding of design as a tool to achieve measurable business outcomes. A thoughtful answer indicates they value the results of their work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has caused delays in your past projects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Delays are a natural part of projects with multiple moving parts. By asking this, you’ll gain insights into their project management experience and how they handle challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you handle feedback and revisions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Good designers see feedback as an integral part of the process. Their ability to accept, process, and act on feedback is critical to delivering a design that meets your expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions help establish the designer’s professionalism, adaptability, and problem-solving skills, making it easier to evaluate if they’re the right fit for your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-freelancer-vs-agency-which-is-right-for-you&quot;&gt;6. Freelancer vs. Agency: Which is Right for You?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing between a freelancer and an agency depends on the nature of your project and your business needs. Here’s a breakdown of when each option might be appropriate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;when-to-hire-a-freelancer&quot;&gt;When to Hire a Freelancer&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freelancers can be a great choice if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your project is small or highly specific.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have a limited budget.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You already have a clear vision and don’t need extensive strategy or team collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re comfortable with some flexibility in timelines, as freelancers often juggle multiple clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, freelancers may not be ideal for large-scale or long-term projects where teamwork and diverse skill sets are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;when-to-hire-an-agency&quot;&gt;When to Hire an Agency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agencies are better suited for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large, complex projects requiring diverse expertise, such as research, design, and development.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long-term projects where consistent support and collaboration are needed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Situations where reliability and scalability are critical, as agencies typically have dedicated teams and processes to ensure continuity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Businesses seeking strategic guidance in addition to design services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While agencies can be more expensive than freelancers, their team-based approach and structured workflows often result in higher-quality outcomes, particularly for complex or high-stakes projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-budgeting-and-timeline-considerations&quot;&gt;7. Budgeting and Timeline Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;setting-realistic-budgets&quot;&gt;Setting Realistic Budgets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When determining your budget for a UX design project, it’s helpful to follow these guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allocate Adequate Resources for Design:&lt;/strong&gt; A good rule of thumb is to assign an amount equivalent to the estimated development costs for web applications. For mobile apps, design costs may be slightly lower than development costs but still significant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Cutting Corners:&lt;/strong&gt; Skipping the design phase or rushing through it often leads to delays and cost escalations during development. Proper design planning can prevent expensive fixes later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;establishing-timelines&quot;&gt;Establishing Timelines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeline for your project will depend on its complexity and scope. UX design typically involves multiple stages, including research, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing. Discuss realistic deadlines with your designer or agency upfront and plan for some flexibility to accommodate feedback and revisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-evaluating-technical-expertise-and-tools&quot;&gt;8. Evaluating Technical Expertise and Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UX design process often involves various tools and technologies. While you may not need to dictate the tools your designers use, you should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand the Outputs You’ll Receive:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure the final deliverables (e.g., prototypes, wireframes, or style guides) are in formats that your development team can easily work with.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask About Tools They Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Popular platforms like Figma (for UX/UI design), Adobe XD, and Sketch are industry standards for design, while tools like Miro or FigJam might be used for collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already have a design team in-house or a preferred development framework, confirm compatibility between their tools and the outputs you’ll need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-the-role-of-communication-in-successful-collaboration&quot;&gt;9. The Role of Communication in Successful Collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective communication is crucial for the success of any design project. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarity in Process and Goals:&lt;/strong&gt; A designer or agency should be able to explain their process in plain terms and ensure your goals are well understood.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proactive Updates:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular updates on progress, challenges, and next steps keep the project on track and build trust.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing Communication Style:&lt;/strong&gt; You can gauge communication style by how they respond to your initial queries. Agencies with blogs or resources that clearly explain their approach often excel in communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, a team that communicates well is more likely to resolve issues efficiently and ensure a smooth project experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-evaluating-understanding-of-your-goals-and-user-base&quot;&gt;10. Evaluating Understanding of Your Goals and User Base&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A successful UX design project depends on the designer’s ability to grasp your business objectives and audience needs. Here’s how you can evaluate this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess Their Proposal:&lt;/strong&gt; After an initial briefing, the agency should deliver a well-structured proposal. This document should clearly reflect your business goals, the problem to be solved, and their understanding of your user base.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of Questions:&lt;/strong&gt; Pay attention to the types of questions the designer or agency asks during initial discussions. Are they probing deeper into your objectives, target audience, and potential challenges? This indicates how thoroughly they aim to tailor their approach to your needs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ability to Align with Your Brand:&lt;/strong&gt; The designer should demonstrate an understanding of your brand identity and values. This ensures the end product resonates with your audience and maintains consistency with your broader marketing efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thorough discovery phase and thoughtful proposal are strong indicators of a team that prioritises understanding your unique needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;11-conclusion&quot;&gt;11. Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiring a UX designer, whether a freelancer or an agency, is a crucial step in creating user-centric products that align with your business goals. To make the right choice, it’s essential to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clearly define your project objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look for designers with a solid process, strong portfolios, and relevant experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask insightful questions to gauge their expertise, adaptability, and communication skills.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decide between freelancers and agencies based on the scale, complexity, and long-term impact of your project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in UX design early not only saves time and resources in the development phase but also ensures that your product effectively serves your audience and achieves your business objectives. By following these guidelines, you’ll be well-equipped to find the right partner and set your project up for success.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Design Proposals that Boost Conversion Rates</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building proposal templates takes a lot of effort and you’re still left unsure of whether you’ve done it right. This article tries to help you fix that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;creating-a-winning-ux-design-proposal-a-comprehensive-guide&quot;&gt;Creating a Winning UX Design Proposal: A Comprehensive Guide&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crafting a UX design proposal can be challenging, but it is also an invaluable tool in securing new projects and demonstrating professionalism. A well-structured proposal not only showcases your understanding of the client’s needs but also reflects your agency’s strengths and your ability to foresee potential project challenges. Based on my years running a UX design agency, here’s a guide to creating a compelling proposal that can boost your conversion rates and help you stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-understanding-the-purpose-of-a-proposal&quot;&gt;1. Understanding the Purpose of a Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proposal is essentially the answer to the client’s questions before they commit to hiring you. They want to know if you understand their project, if you’re aligned on goals, and if your capabilities and deliverables match their expectations. Answering these questions clearly within your proposal gives clients the confidence they need to move forward with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-key-components-of-a-ux-proposal&quot;&gt;2. Key Components of a UX Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make your proposal thorough and professional, include these eight essential components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-summary&quot;&gt;Project Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary should ensure everyone is on the same page. Here, outline the specific project objectives, emphasising the agreed-upon approach. If your agency has unique strengths, such as a technical or development background, this is the place to highlight them. This section serves as a commitment to the client, defining exactly what you’ll focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feature-list&quot;&gt;Feature List&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most time-intensive sections, the feature list outlines the project at a high level, covering major elements without getting overly technical. For instance, if the project includes user authentication, mention this as a feature but avoid specific technical details like whether it will include OTP verification. This list demonstrates thorough planning, showing that you’re not just sending a generic proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scope-of-work&quot;&gt;Scope of Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline all the deliverables you’ll provide. This section can also serve as a showcase for your agency’s full capabilities, even if some services aren’t part of this specific project. For example, list everything from wireframing to prototyping, and clarify which tools and formats you’ll use. Ensuring clarity on deliverables avoids confusion later on and establishes a sense of professionalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;team-structure&quot;&gt;Team Structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explain who will be working on the project, their roles, and their experience levels. This can include a project manager, UX/UI designers, and other support roles like content creators or icon designers. Detailing your team structure justifies your pricing, showing the client that the work involves skilled professionals rather than being handled solely by a generalist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engagement-guidelines&quot;&gt;Engagement Guidelines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set out expectations on both sides. Define a single point of contact (Spock) on your team and request the same on the client’s end to streamline communication. Specify a regular meeting cadence, like weekly check-ins, to keep the project on track. This section also covers managing scope changes and clarifies your availability to avoid client requests at odd hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;support&quot;&gt;Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support goes beyond project completion, as clients may need assistance once the design phase is over. Typically, offer 30 days of support post-handover to handle clarifications and minor adjustments, but make it clear that extensive support beyond this window will incur additional charges. This also includes defining the method of support, whether remote or on-site, with associated travel costs if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cost-and-packages&quot;&gt;Cost and Packages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costing can be a make-or-break aspect of your proposal. Offering tiered packages—bare minimum, standard, and premium—can appeal to different budgets and give clients flexibility. Using a worksheet to customise package features and pricing quickly allows you to respond to client requests efficiently, showing professionalism and organisational readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;payment-schedule-and-protection-clauses&quot;&gt;Payment Schedule and Protection Clauses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing a payment schedule is essential for cash flow and client commitment. A common approach is 50% upfront, 25% midway, and the remaining 25% upon completion. Clearly state conditions for payment delays, such as the right to halt or terminate the project if payments are not made on time. Including protection clauses safeguards your interests, and clients typically view them as standard business practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;additional-annexures&quot;&gt;Additional Annexures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, append any extra information that can strengthen your proposal, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: Highlight your agency’s expertise and how you stand out. Large clients, especially, may appreciate a quick reference on your background without needing to research separately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Client Portfolio&lt;/strong&gt;: Showcasing similar past projects builds credibility. If your client seeks an e-commerce solution, for example, list other e-commerce projects you’ve completed to demonstrate your experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Bios (Optional)&lt;/strong&gt;: If certain team members have notable expertise, add brief bios. This personal touch can reinforce the unique value you bring to the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-recognising-common-proposal-traps&quot;&gt;3. Recognising Common Proposal Traps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all proposal requests are genuine. Some clients may seek proposals simply to benchmark costs, fulfil internal bidding quotas, or collect ideas without intending to hire. Though you can’t always avoid such situations, by treating ideas as renewable and presenting your unique perspective, you position yourself as a resourceful, innovative partner for potential clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-automating-for-efficiency-to-an-extent&quot;&gt;4. Automating for Efficiency (to an Extent)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automating repetitive proposal elements, like feature lists or pricing structures, can streamline your process. However, automation shouldn’t replace human interaction altogether. Proposals play a vital role in assessing potential clients and understanding their unique needs, so a fully automated system risks undermining this relationship-building opportunity. I chose to keep personal contact integral to my process, which allowed me to enjoy a diverse range of projects with clients I valued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-crafted UX design proposal is more than a sales document; it’s an opportunity to build trust and set clear expectations with clients. By including comprehensive components, adapting to different client needs, and presenting a strong sense of your agency’s capabilities, your proposal can serve as a valuable tool for both winning projects and ensuring smooth collaboration throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this framework, I hope you’ll find the proposal process smoother, more efficient, and ultimately more successful.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Designing Web3 Wallets for Mainstream Users</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a problem with Web3 wallets, they’re just too complex. But where’s the problem stemming from and how do we solve it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;web3-wallets-for-mainstream-users&quot;&gt;Web3 Wallets for Mainstream Users&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web3, the next phase of the internet powered by blockchain technology, promises to revolutionise industries, but its complexity continues to alienate mainstream users. At the heart of this challenge is the Web3 wallet—a fundamental tool required for engaging with decentralised applications (dApps), managing cryptocurrencies, and accessing blockchain networks. While Web3 enthusiasts have embraced the wallet system, its cryptographic foundations and technical jargon have left everyday users overwhelmed and frustrated. To drive mainstream adoption of Web3, we need to focus on fixing the wallet experience, making it intuitive and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we’ll explore why the wallet is the crux of Web3 usability challenges and how a thoughtful redesign grounded in familiar concepts, like banking, can unlock its full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-wallet-conundrum-complexity-meets-confusion&quot;&gt;The Wallet Conundrum: Complexity Meets Confusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary function of a Web3 wallet is to store a user’s private and public keys. These cryptographic keys are used to authorise transactions and prove the user’s identity within the blockchain ecosystem. But this process, while secure and revolutionary, is incredibly foreign to non-technical users. Terms like “private key,” “public key,” and “signing messages” can cause even the most tech-savvy Web2 users to shy away. The need for simplification is apparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Web2, users can easily send and receive money through banks or payment apps without ever having to understand the mechanics behind these systems. Web3, by contrast, demands users grasp cryptographic principles or risk losing access to their digital assets. The complexity isn’t just a barrier; it’s a deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many existing wallets, such as Zerion or Rabby, have attempted to ease the user experience by iterating on older designs. And while they have indeed made Web3 more user-friendly, they still fall short of the mainstream appeal necessary for broad adoption. These wallets are excellent by Web3 standards, but they remain inscrutable for the average Web2 user, leaving us to ask: Why can’t a Web3 wallet be as intuitive as the apps we’re already accustomed to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;terminology-matters-the-language-of-web3&quot;&gt;Terminology Matters: The Language of Web3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant part of the problem lies in the terminology itself. In Web3, terms like “wallet” are used inaccurately. In traditional banking, a wallet implies a place where you store something—cash, cards, and other financial instruments. However, in Web3, a wallet doesn’t “store” money in the traditional sense. Instead, it acts more like an access card to funds stored on the blockchain. Misleading terminology adds to the confusion, making it harder for users to understand how to manage their digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source development, which is central to the Web3 ecosystem, has contributed to this confusion. Over time, various developers have used different terms to describe the same concepts, leading to inconsistent vocabulary across platforms. For instance, “public key,” “wallet address,” and “externally owned account” all refer to the same thing, but new users won’t know that. This inconsistency hinders their ability to trust and navigate the system confidently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language is powerful, and when users encounter familiar terms, they can better grasp unfamiliar concepts. Web2 sites like e-commerce platforms utilise relatable language (“add to cart,” “checkout”) that immediately makes sense to users. The same approach needs to be applied to Web3 wallets if we want to make them accessible to the average person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-familiarity-banking-as-a-metaphor&quot;&gt;Building Familiarity: Banking as a Metaphor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve the wallet problem, we need to rethink the entire framework. Instead of framing wallets with cryptographic jargon, we should use a metaphor that resonates with mainstream users. And what’s more familiar than banking? Banking is a 2,000-year-old institution, and most people are already acquainted with its core concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By reimagining the Web3 wallet as a piece of “banking software,” we can translate complex blockchain concepts into terms users already understand. For instance, the wallet itself could be referred to as “banking software,” the wallet address as an “account number,” the private key as a “signature,” blockchain networks as “networks,” and the various fees associated with a transaction such as “tip”, “gas” and such could be simplified into “transaction fees,” just as people are used to paying on traditional payment platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This banking analogy would not only make Web3 wallets more relatable but also help ease users into the system without overwhelming them with technical details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-three-account-structure-enhancing-security-and-usability&quot;&gt;A Three-Account Structure: Enhancing Security and Usability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to simplifying the terminology, a redesigned Web3 wallet should also mimic the structure of traditional banking. A banking app typically offers various types of accounts—checking, savings, and investment—and the same can be applied to Web3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checking Account&lt;/strong&gt;: This would be where users conduct everyday transactions with known entities or individuals, similar to a checking account in traditional banking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savings Account&lt;/strong&gt;: This would serve as a secure place to store assets, where users could stake cryptocurrencies or simply keep them safe. It would allow users to generate interest on their holdings without needing to interact with external applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment Account&lt;/strong&gt;: For users seeking higher risk and reward opportunities, this account would enable interaction with decentralised applications (dApps) for staking, lending, or other investment activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This compartmentalisation not only makes the system more intuitive but also enhances security. By limiting the interactions of the checking and savings accounts with external applications, users can reduce their exposure to potential security risks. Only the investment account, which is meant for higher-risk activities, would be open to external dApps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-road-ahead-evolving-web3-for-the-mainstream&quot;&gt;The Road Ahead: Evolving Web3 for the Mainstream&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the wallet is the linchpin of Web3 adoption. If we can make the wallet experience seamless and intuitive, we can unlock Web3’s immense potential for a wider audience. The key lies in rethinking both the terminology and structure, using familiar banking concepts to demystify the process. By addressing these foundational issues, we can bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, paving the way for mass adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For designers and developers working on Web3 applications, this means prioritising usability over technical prowess. It means considering what mainstream users already know and building upon that knowledge, rather than introducing new, foreign concepts. The future of Web3 is bright, but only if we can make it accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five personal AI assistant devices reviewed and what they need to fix</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The world of AI assistants has taken a sharp leap forward with new devices emerging every year. However, despite the excitement around these personal AI assistant devices, many haven’t lived up to their full potential. Having headed a UX design agency ranked among the top 100 globally, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges and nuances of designing new tech. Today, I want to share with you seven critical mistakes these products are making—and how I believe we can fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-arent-personal-ai-assistants-taking-off&quot;&gt;Why Aren’t Personal AI Assistants Taking Off?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the nitty-gritty, let’s get one thing clear. The personal AI assistants I’m referring to aren’t like Siri or Google Assistant on your phone. We’re talking about devices that can break down complex tasks and execute them for you—whether it’s running apps, searching the web, or even coding in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These devices are mostly aimed at early adopters right now, but the goal is to create something for everyone. If you picture the product adoption lifecycle, we’re still in the early adopter phase. Right now, companies are testing their products in different niches, trying to figure out what sticks. It’s a chaotic phase, and we’re seeing an explosion of ideas—some good, some not so much. A lot of these ideas won’t make it to the mainstream, but that’s what makes this phase so exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s dig into the seven mistakes these AI assistant products are making and how I think they can course-correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-not-using-the-right-metaphor&quot;&gt;1. Not Using the Right Metaphor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first mistake is starting with the wrong metaphor. Products need to fit into a framework that users already understand. People don’t like adopting something completely alien. I always say evolution trumps revolution, especially in mass-market products. Finding a metaphor that connects the new with the familiar is crucial. AI assistants should be positioned as an evolution of tools people already know, not a radical shift that alienates potential users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-limited-accessibility-and-reachability&quot;&gt;2. Limited Accessibility and Reachability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an AI assistant to succeed, it needs to be extremely accessible. Think about the evolution of computing—from desktops to laptops, tablets, smartphones, and now wearables. The goal is to bring tech closer to the user. Personal AI devices need to occupy that space between a smartphone and the user—something wearable that’s always available at a moment’s notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users are going to need to learn a new behaviour—one where they think in terms of goals, not apps. The easier we make it for them to access the assistant, the quicker they’ll adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-lack-of-multimodal-inputs-and-outputs&quot;&gt;3. Lack of Multimodal Inputs and Outputs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest—audio alone isn’t enough. Yes, voice commands are intuitive and efficient for certain tasks, but information needs to be delivered in various ways. Visual feedback, like images and text, allows users to process information faster. Devices that rely only on voice, like some AI pins or pendants, miss out on the efficiency that visual data provides. The solution is to design devices with both visual and auditory outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-poor-data-privacy-protections&quot;&gt;4. Poor Data Privacy Protections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With AI, the question of privacy becomes even more critical. These devices will have access to mountains of personal data, and without strong privacy protections, they could easily become surveillance tools. The safest way to ensure privacy? Keep the data on the device itself. I think open-source projects like Open Interpreter, which runs locally on the user’s device, are on the right track. This model protects privacy and offers immediate feedback—something that cloud-based models struggle with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-lag-in-response-time&quot;&gt;5. Lag in Response Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For AI assistants to feel natural, they need to respond quickly. Research shows that interactions that take longer than 400 milliseconds feel slow and clunky. Devices relying on cloud-based AI models are always going to have some lag, no matter how fast the server is. To hit that magical threshold of 400 milliseconds, AI models need to run locally on the device. Otherwise, users will experience delays that break the flow of interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-lack-of-interoperability&quot;&gt;6. Lack of Interoperability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re transitioning to a new kind of computing—one where AI agents handle tasks for us. These agents need to be able to interact seamlessly with existing systems and applications. If a user wants their AI assistant to book an Uber or play a song on Spotify, the interaction needs to be flawless. Devices that struggle with this will quickly fall out of favour. The future belongs to AI assistants that can bridge both the current and future computing models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-failure-to-create-universal-interfaces&quot;&gt;7. Failure to Create Universal Interfaces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final mistake I see is the lack of universal, adaptable interfaces. Every request a user makes might require a different interface—one that adapts in real-time. If I ask my AI assistant to book an Uber, the interface might display a map. If I want to pick between two songs, I’ll need a list. These interfaces need to be generated on the fly, based on the user’s specific request. A rigid interface simply won’t cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-of-ai-assistants&quot;&gt;The Future of AI Assistants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the best form factor for personal AI assistants is a wearable device—specifically a smartwatch. It’s close to the user, easy to access, and can incorporate the necessary screen for visual feedback. While today’s smartwatches may not have the power to run advanced AI models, the tech is catching up. With chip technology becoming more efficient and AI models getting smaller, we’re not far from a future where AI-powered smartwatches will be the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, while none of the current products on the market have quite nailed it yet, some are closer than others. But in the end, it’s the big players—Google, Microsoft, and Meta—that are best positioned to dominate the personal AI assistant space. They have the data, and in AI, data is king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I root for the underdog, I wouldn’t bet my money on any of the current startups trying to break into this space. The race will be won by those with the resources to gather and process the vast amounts of data required to create truly effective AI assistants.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Designing a better feature request system</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If we get feedback and feature requests from users regarding products we’ve built, we get valuable insights into understanding what the users want. This is a great place to involve LLMs to handle the issues involved in this process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feedback system will do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It will allow users to submit their feature requests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To handle the problem of faster horses, it will produce a page where users can vote on things they didn’t think of before&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It will show a priority list to product teams that will allow them to understand what to develop next&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The same idea can be ported to handling bugs, but it needs to be a separate system altogether&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>DIY: A Raspberry Pi based Time Capsule</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I built an efficient Apple Time Capsule clone that will perform the task of allowing any externally connected hard drive to be used as a backup destination using the Time Machine setup on your Mac.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-this-is&quot;&gt;What this is&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to build your own Apple Time Capsule clone using the Raspberry Pi and an external hard drive, this is the slimmest and most efficient solution that you could build in under an hour, without the bonus 3D printing bit in the end of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also be successful if you just follow the steps below, but there’s a step where you need to find your Raspberry Pi on your network and reserve a specific IP address in your router which I won’t be going into that may require some prior knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-unique-about-this-solution&quot;&gt;What’s unique about this solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution has the following characteristics that make it different from other solutions that you may have seen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t need any other software such as Open Media Vault, which is great if you want to do a whole bunch of other things, but is too much of an overhead if all you want to do is build a network backup solution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This could be setup on very low horse-powered boards like the Raspberry Pi 3A+ as it runs with the services built into the OS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This solution works with more than one Mac on your network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can do this for guest logins on a network and doesn’t require an account to be setup on the Pi, so this makes it easy to use for a home environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;requirements&quot;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need the following as a minimum:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ with compatible power supply&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Micro SD Card with 4GB or more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;External hard drive of any capacity that is compatible with the Raspberry Pi’s USB port&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The drive will work with most laptops using different OS’s in case that’s needed at any time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi Imager software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;software-setup&quot;&gt;Software Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-create-the-sd-card-image&quot;&gt;Step 1: Create the SD card image&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this, simply do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1&lt;/strong&gt; Download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi Imager&lt;/a&gt; software and open the file and follow the instructions to install the software on your Mac as you would any other software
   &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-9.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.2&lt;/strong&gt; Plug in the Micro SD card into your Mac. It doesn’t matter if it isn’t already formatted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.3&lt;/strong&gt; Choose the Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) image to write to the Micro SD card
   &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1.4&lt;/strong&gt; Choose the Micro SD card that you just inserted into your Mac as the storage destination and click ‘Next’
   &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1.5&lt;/strong&gt; In the next step of OS customisation, make sure to Edit Settings and in the first tab
   &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-5.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.5.1&lt;/strong&gt; Setup the host name – this is the name of your Pi on the network. I’ve called mine “pinstripes”, but you could just call it “timecapsule” or anything else you’d like
   &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-6.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.5.2&lt;/strong&gt; User name and password for the machine. I suggest you set it to the default username and password for now which are ‘pi’ and ‘raspberry’. You can change this later if you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.5.3&lt;/strong&gt; Provide the SSID and password to enable it to connect to your Wifi network. You don’t need this if you’re using a different Raspberry Pi that connects using a LAN cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.5.4&lt;/strong&gt; On the second tab called “Services”, make sure that you enable SSH and use the password authentication mechanism. This will allow you to remotely log into your Pi with the user name and password that you setup in the previous step.
   &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-7.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.5.5&lt;/strong&gt; Hit “Save” and in the next screen click “Yes” and then “Next” to begin the imaging step. You may need to type in your login and password for your computer to tell your computer that you authorise this action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In about 15 minutes your Micro SD card is going to be ready. Just eject your card if not already done before pulling it out of your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-initialise-your-pi-and-set-it-up-on-your-network&quot;&gt;Step 2: Initialise your Pi and set it up on your network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1&lt;/strong&gt; Setup the host name – this is the name of your Pi on the network, so you could just call it “timecapsule” for simplicity or name it anything else you’d likePlug in your Micro SD card into your Pi and then plug in the power cable to the Pi. After about 5 minutes, the Pi would have booted up and then connected to your network over Wifi (or LAN in case that’s how you’d connected). You don’t need to plug in your external hard drive to the Pi as yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.2&lt;/strong&gt;  Open up a Terminal window on a laptop on the network and type in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ping timecapsule.local&lt;/code&gt;. Replace “timecapsule” with whatever you named your Pi in Step 1.5.1. This should return the IP address of your Pi on the network.
   &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-10.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.3&lt;/strong&gt;  Now type in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;arp -a&lt;/code&gt; and get the MAC addresses of all the devices connected to your network. Look for the Pi’s MAC address that corresponds to its IP address you found in the previous step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.4&lt;/strong&gt; Now log into your router which assigns the IP addresses on your network and setup a fixed IP address for your Raspberry Pi’s MAC address. This whole thing may work without this address reservation, but I’ve never tested it. So if you absolutely cannot perform this step, just go through the rest and let me know if it works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.5&lt;/strong&gt; If you’ve reserved a specific IP address for your Pi and it is different from the one it is currently assigned, you will need to reboot your Pi by turning off the power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.6&lt;/strong&gt; Once your Pi comes back on your network, go back to your Terminal window and type in the following to log into your Pi through SSH - &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh pi@192.168.0.10&lt;/code&gt; where ‘pi’ is the user name and the IP address is the one that you reserved for your Pi in step 2.4. If everything is setup properly, your Pi will ask you for a password and you could just type in ‘raspberry’ or whatever else you set up in Step 1.5.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3-prepare-your-external-hard-drive&quot;&gt;Step 3: Prepare your external hard drive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1&lt;/strong&gt; Get your external drive. Be sure you’re using a hard drive that doesn’t have any data that you want to retain as it will be lost forever once you’re done with this step. Connect the hard drive to your Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.2&lt;/strong&gt; Use “Disk Utility” to Erase and initialise your external drive. Name the drive anything you’d like such as “TimeCapsule” but make sure to use “Exfat” and if asked, the “GUID” options for maximum compatibility of the drive across different OS’s. 
&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-11.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-12.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.3&lt;/strong&gt; Once the process is complete, eject your drive from your laptop. It is ready for plugging into your Pi in the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4-get-the-software-setup&quot;&gt;Step 4: Get the software setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.1&lt;/strong&gt; While connected to your Pi through a Terminal window, do the following to update your Pi’s OS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-13.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
5
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1. `sudo apt update`
2. `sudo apt upgrade`
3. `sudo apt install exfat-fuse -y`
4. `sudo apt install samba -y
5. `sudo apt install avahi-daemon -y`
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2&lt;/strong&gt; Once the above packages are installed, let’s mount the external drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2.1&lt;/strong&gt; Plug in your external drive into the Pi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2.2&lt;/strong&gt; Type in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo df -Th&lt;/code&gt; which will list all the drives connected to the Pi. Find the identifier for your drive which should most likely be “sda2” but could be different too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2.3&lt;/strong&gt; Create a mount point by typing in the following commands &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo mkdir /mnt/timecapsule&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo mount -t exfat /dev/sda2 /mnt/timecapsule&lt;/code&gt;. Just substitute “sda2” with whatever the drive’s identifier actually is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2.4&lt;/strong&gt; Type in the following to find the UUID of your drive &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lsblk -f&lt;/code&gt; and all the drives connected to your Pi will show up (including the Micro SD card). Look for the UUID of the drive with the label ‘TimeCapsule’ if that’s what you named the drive in Step 3.2. Cross verify against the size of the drive to be sure. Copy the UUID into the clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2.5&lt;/strong&gt; To make the mount point persist across reboots of the Pi, you will need to add the following code to the file named “fstab”. You can do that by: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo nano /etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2.6&lt;/strong&gt; Paste the following in the end of the file  &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UUID=your-uuid /mnt/timecapsule exfat defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=000 0 0&lt;/code&gt; but replace the UUID with the one you copied to the clipboard in the previous step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2.7&lt;/strong&gt; Press Ctrl-X to save the file, Yes to write the buffer to file and enter to rewrite the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.3&lt;/strong&gt; Now write the configuration file to Samba, which is the file networking service that shows the drive on a network in a form that is compatible with Macs and Windows. To do this, you need to write the following code into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;smb.conf&lt;/code&gt; file by typing in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf&lt;/code&gt; which should bring up the existing configurations in the file. Press the page down key on your keyboard to get to the end of the page and paste this and make sure the mount points are correct:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.4&lt;/strong&gt; Save the file as the other files in step 2.5.3 and then restart the service with the new configurations by typing in the command into your command prompt in the Terminal &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo systemctl restart smbd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.5&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve got to do the same for the avahi service configuration. To edit the file, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo nano /etc/avahi/services/samba.service&lt;/code&gt; and paste the following code. There are no changes needed to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.6&lt;/strong&gt; Save the file as in step 2.5.3 and then restart the service by typing in the following command &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo systemctl restart avahi-daemon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest restarting the device itself to make sure that it works even if it ends up restarting on it’s own in the future. To do this, type in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo reboot now&lt;/code&gt; into your Terminal command prompt. This will disconnect your session and restart the Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, you’re ready to go and setup the Time Machine backup from your Mac as always!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;troubleshooting&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for any reason you don’t see the newly setup drive when you are setting up Time Machine on your Mac, try to connect to the drive first on the network by going to the Finder &amp;gt; Go &amp;gt; Connect to Server and then typing in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;smb://192.168.0.25&lt;/code&gt; replacing this with the IP address of your newly setup Time Capsule. You should be able to connect to the Raspberry Pi drive. Post that the Time Machine should automatically find the drive on the network. If for any reason this still doesn’t work, there’s probably some step above that you’ve missed. So give that a shot again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-14.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/timecapsule/timecapsule-15.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-step&quot;&gt;Bonus Step&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a case for the Raspberry Pi and the hard drive to be situated together. I’m designing something for this purpose and should have a 3D printable file posted here soon. Check back in a bit. But if you’d like to print something else, look at the plethora of stuff that’s available to you on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.printables.com/search/models?q=raspberry%20pi%203a+&amp;amp;ctx=models&quot;&gt;Printables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where the puck is going to be</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Product design requires you to imagine the future version of a product, but how do you do it reliably? Ice Hockey may offer some insights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;ice-hockey-and-product-design&quot;&gt;Ice Hockey and Product Design&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Wayne Gretsky quote that goes, “I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it is”, the way to win is to accurately anticipate the future outcomes as accurately as possible. The principle could be applied to product design too. The way to design a successful product is to know what the next version of the product is going to be. But the challenge of knowing what that is as challenging as judging where the hockey puck is going to be on the ice rink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while no one can be absolutely certain where exactly the puck is going to be on the rink at any given point in time, one thing everyone can be absolutely certain about is that the puck is headed towards the other team’s goal. In a similar way the product’s end goal is to suit the needs of the consumer perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consumer is human. The form the product must then take is to suit the form of a human body. If the product is meant to be held, it must fit the hand perfectly. If it is meant to be worn on the ear, then it must fit various ear types. If it is meant to be used over a period of time, then it must use materials that will not strain the user during that period. In terms of the function it performs, it must serve the needs of the human as accurately while also needing as little effort as possible. The final version of the product therefore is possible to define, at least in the abstract. If it’s not a physical product, the final form is one that serves the needs of the user perfectly and is extremely simple to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate the idea with some examples. Consider the evolution of the USB cable. Type A USB cables required the user guess which way should be facing up before plugging it into a socket. Many users struggled with this and the act of plugging in the USB A cable into a socket was a hit or a miss &lt;em&gt;every time&lt;/em&gt;. Making the cable pluggable into a socket in either orientation therefore was obvious. Therefore that’s what happened in the future iteration of the USB C cable. 
&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/USBCables.png&quot; /&gt;
Another issue with the cable was that the sockets it plugged into on the other side was variable. There were the USB A plug, USB B plug, a mini USB plug and even a micro USB plug. You therefore had to have at least one cable of each type in order to be able to connect with various device types that one bought over time, not to mention the proprietary cables that were required by some devices like smart watches. Intuitively one can see that these were too many cables to basically perform the same task. Again, no wonder the USB C cable’s invention. As of the time of writing this article, the USB C cable too has various types, the ones that supply current and the ones that also transfer data. How long do you think that’s going to stay that way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same principle can be applied to Generative AI tools – do you think specialised prompts are going to be required much longer; computer keyboards – are they more convenient than speech;  or even subscription services – will Adobe get away with charging cancellation charges for their subscription service for much longer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or even consider the iPad. What was it’s evolution? I’d postulate that it came about because someone thought that the computers of the time were too “unnatural” for a human to use. Having a user type using a keyboard to communicate something or using a mouse or a track pad to point at something is a hard challenge for people who aren’t familiar with computers. Humans communicate by speaking, they point to things with their fingers. The iPad is a step in that direction. What would the future of this device be? Well, a computer that let’s a user express themselves with all the tools they have at their disposal – from communicating with their voice, pointing with their fingers or even setting the context of what they’re talking about by facing in a particular direction or looking at something with their eyes. The display of the iPad is an intermediate expression of the limitations of current technology. The computer of the future will not be something that is picked up and stared at with your head bent down. If you think the Apple Vision Pro headset is a step in that direction, I would agree that it is. But it’s not the end point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/InstructionMethods.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end point is something that will be even more seamless. It will be an assistant that the user can just converse with, something that can understand the full range of expressions that humans can emote with their faces, eyes, hand gestures, body positions and language and it will be seamless and something that is worn and always available. It will enable the user to do and perform everything they need in the real world but also to understand and appreciate everything much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this to happen, we need a voice assistant with infinite knowledge and ability to learn about the human, wireless technologies that will seamlessly stay connected at all times, face tracking, body tracking, motion tracking, gesture tracking and even battery technology that will not only power something like this, but be in a form that is far more shaped like the person who will wear it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These intermediate states therefore are not dictated not by the human being it is meant to serve, but by other constraints such as materials available, the tools, technologies, the people available to build that next version, legal and environmental constraints, the organisational politics, available marketing budgets or even the designer’s inability to understand who the user is. But knowing that these are necessary stages of evolution will allow the designers to keep their eye on the eventual goal. The task of the product designer or even the entrepreneur building this product is to negotiate the most efficient course between the current state of the product through to the final destination it is meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My experiments with 3D printing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My foray into the world of 3D printing and my learnings and insights so far. This is work in progress and will continue to be edited.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3d-printing-a-journey-into-a-promising-yet-challenging-field&quot;&gt;3D Printing: A Journey into a Promising, Yet Challenging Field&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in around 2015, I stumbled upon 3D printers during their nascent stage. The potential was clear, but the technology wasn’t quite there yet, and it was relegated to a niche space for tech enthusiasts. As a UX designer, my curiosity was piqued, especially considering the initial buzz surrounding its potential impact on ecommerce and logistics. However, being based in India at the time, affordability, availability of replacement parts, and local support were significant barriers to entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2023, I was blown away by an amazing YouTube video showcasing a user designing and printing all the shelves he needed for his desk, as well as custom SD card holders. This experience resonated with me, reminding me of the excitement I get when visiting a hardware store or a craft shop, imagining the possibilities of creating useful things. I was eager to explore this technology further and get my hands on a 3D printer to discover what I could create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-right-printer-for-me-balancing-usability-and-performance&quot;&gt;The Right Printer for Me: Balancing Usability and Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the 3D printing industry evolved, so did its focus on user experience. Although there are numerous resources available online for fine-tuning printers, many models offer excellent results straight out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the printing technologies, I narrowed down my choices to Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) and Vat Polymerisation (VP) printers due to their popularity in the consumer space. VP printing introduced some unique challenges like the need for ventilation and dealing with smells arising from resin. Given that I wanted the printer to remain in my study, I opted for FDM. After thorough research, I selected a printer that offered ease of assembly, maintenance, and accessibility to support. The Bambu Labs X1 and Elegoo Neptune 4 Plus stood out, but ultimately, I went with the Neptune 4 due to its lower cost and absence of proprietary parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unboxing-and-setting-up-overcoming-challenges-together&quot;&gt;Unboxing and Setting Up: Overcoming Challenges Together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delivery took around a month due to pre-ordering, arriving during Christmas holidays, offering ample time for me to delve into learning about 3D printing. The setup was straightforward, but there were some complications like ensuring the correct cables were connected and checking voltage settings on the printer bed. Although these tasks weren’t particularly challenging for a technologically inclined user, they required careful attention and a bit of research to ensure a seamless experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the occasional hurdles, the experience was rewarding, as I was able to build my 3D printer from scratch with all necessary tools supplied. The desktop software that came with the Neptune 4 pleasantly surprised me with pre-installed printable files of a tool stand for the printer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;designing-the-gap-in-the-ux-of-3d-modelling&quot;&gt;Designing: The Gap in the UX of 3D Modelling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design process in 3D modelling is complex and requires a good understanding of visualising 2D cross-sectional shapes to create 3D objects. Sculpting tools like Blender are suitable for creating aesthetically pleasing, non-functional designs, while functional 3D design tools like OnShape offer the best capabilities for product designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OnShape, a cloud-based platform, boasts responsive and great tools that keep users updated with the latest features. However, the pricing could use improvement to cater to hobbyists and make entry into this space more accessible. Simplifying design tools by incorporating user-friendly features specific to 3D printing would further enhance the overall UX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-marketplaces-tools-and-toys-for-everyone&quot;&gt;Design Marketplaces: Tools and Toys for Everyone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Websites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.printables.com&quot;&gt;Printables&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thingiverse.com&quot;&gt;Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt; offer a wealth of user-generated designs, allowing anyone to download and print objects using their 3D printers. This sense of power to create and own is truly exhilarating, enabling users to go from ideation to tangible results in a matter of hours! However, there are challenges like inconsistent quality checks and potential issues with new designers’ designs not being fully optimised for mass consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving the user experience could involve implementing better quality control measures or allowing experienced designers to review and approve new designs before they are released to the public. Additionally, providing more comprehensive information about dimensions, filament requirements, and print time would significantly improve the overall experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;printing-turning-ideas-into-reality&quot;&gt;Printing: Turning Ideas into Reality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Printing in 3D isn’t without its challenges – files need to be converted from design formats (usually STL) to Gcode using slicing software like Cura before being printed. This step involves setting various parameters that determine the quality, strength, and speed of the final print. Although these steps are essential, they can be complex for new users. It is also not apparent to users that they may affect the final look of the object with the changes made to some of these settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streamlining this process by incorporating it into authoring tools would greatly improve the user experience. Until then, there are numerous resources available online to help users learn the intricacies of 3D printing, allowing them to enjoy the satisfaction of turning their ideas into tangible objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion-a-promising-future&quot;&gt;Conclusion: A Promising Future&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential of 3D printing is immense, and I’m confident that significant improvements will be made to address the unique challenges in this space while keeping user experience at the forefront. Like with all the challenges solved in the 2D printing world, I envision 3D printers becoming an integral part of every household or as more likely, in the neighbourhood print shop. The key to realising this lies in simplifying the design authoring tools and making them accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hurdles-and-insights&quot;&gt;Hurdles and Insights&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The plugging in of the cables for the gantry motors still requires some amount of understanding of connectors. This could be further simplified in future versions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The printer plate travels outside the frame of the printer itself which allows a user to make the mistake of placing it too close to a wall and having to learn &lt;em&gt;during printing&lt;/em&gt; that it needs to be moved. This could be explained as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going from 2D to 3D is incredibly difficult and staying in the 3D space from the start would be ideal, but the tools we have today are limited in their ability to express these ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marketplaces are currently aimed at those that own 3D printers, whereas they should be aimed at the end-users of the products that are available on the sites.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are two outcomes to the world of 3D printers, they will either become a part of every household of the future as 2D printers today are, or they will become a part of every neighbourhood print shop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Review of the Rabbit R1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A detailed review of the newly launched Rabbit R1, exploring its hardware and software design, its strategic position in the market and its potential challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-launch-of-something-new&quot;&gt;The Launch of Something New&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that the Rabbit team mimicked Steve Jobs’ keynote would be an understatement! The only thing missing was the Vera Wang turtleneck—it was a black t-shirt instead. Otherwise, the presentation featured the same slide style from Apple Keynote with the gradient, the same format, the hand gestures, and even the “One more thing…” announcement at the end. But OnePlus did this before too, turtleneck included. While it was considered cringe-worthy at the time, the product compensated for the lack of originality in the presentation. So, let’s not dwell on style and focus on the substance instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tech world has been in pursuit of two things over the past couple of years. The first is an answer to what will replace the smartphone. Depending on whom you ask, the smartphone has remained relatively unchanged since its debut in 2007. It has been upgraded in small ways with better screens, cameras, and sensors, but otherwise, the form factor has stayed largely the same since the beginning, despite some major flaws in the structure. But it’s been more than 16 years, Steve Jobs isn’t around, and everyone is looking for the smartphone killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT has demonstrated to everyone how powerful AI assistants can be. The open-source space has also made giant leaps with Llama 2 and Mistral AI models, and you can achieve the same capabilities as ChatGPT, and even the interface, running on your local computer with relative ease using tools like Ollama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the addition of vision, audio, and speech capabilities into AI models, they are now ready to move beyond the browser and integrate into people’s lives, understanding instructions within their own contexts. For this, they may need to leave desktop browser windows and move onto mobile phones instead. But mobile phones are still a reach-into-your-pockets-or-handbag away, and that’s not good enough either. People need something even more readily available. Enter Meta Ray-Ban, Humane’s AI Pin, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, these models have so far been hamstrung by their inability to perform actions on behalf of the user. They cannot yet click buttons on screens and other interfaces, and the OS architecture and security do not allow an app to interact with the interfaces of other apps as yet, and rightly so. But this also means that we have to duplicate actions and information across apps in order to achieve certain goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this backdrop, I think we can evaluate what Rabbit R1 is doing much more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/RabbitR1-2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hardware-design&quot;&gt;Hardware Design&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems they hired &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/@teenageengin33r&quot;&gt;Teenage Engineering&lt;/a&gt; (nice name), which appears to have a penchant for creating retro-futuristic tech products, reminiscent of Dieter Rams’ Braun designs. The design features a very cool, Lego-inspired shell that houses a great-looking touchscreen, a camera on a swivel, a scroll wheel, microphones, a slot for USB and SIM cards, and a push-button on the right side of the product. The touchscreen is a great addition, making interactions with apps, information delivery, and answering questions much faster than the audio-based delivery chosen by the AI Pin by Humane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera on a swivel seems like a good idea, as the R1 can potentially scan the environment to find what a user may be referring to in their instructions. However, the plastic above the camera prevents the device from being held at an angle less than about 45 degrees, meaning the user must position the device almost vertically, like a smartphone, for the camera to see. This is odd, and I’m not sure why this choice was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not just position the camera on the very edge without the top plastic part causing an obstruction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/RabbitR1-3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also struggling to understand the purpose of the analogue scroll wheel. Is it meant to help make selections within the touchscreen interface? That doesn’t seem likely, as it would potentially be faster to use your finger to scroll on the touchscreen itself. Is it intended for manually positioning the camera? If so, positioning it to the right of the camera would have been more logical. Is the idea to enable one-handed scrolling on the touchscreen? If I were holding the device in my left hand, using my index finger to scroll might be easier than using my thumb on the screen, but I would still need to make button selections, and for that, I might be hitting the push-button. This seems like a learned behaviour, but it’s the only explanation I can come up with given my limited understanding. However, if you hold this device in your right hand, the positioning of the scroll wheel becomes even more perplexing! You can’t scroll with the thumb that’s holding the side of the device, and you can’t use your left hand to operate the scroll wheel without blocking your view of the screen. So, why is it designed this way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I didn’t notice any way for the product to be attached to a jacket or shirt, and the placement of the screen and push-button suggests that the R1 is intended to be carried in a pocket and pulled out when needed. This raises a significant concern for me. An AI companion needs to be readily accessible within the user’s physical space to understand instructions better (and to keep the instructions simpler). If it needs to be pulled out of a pocket—or more likely from a bag, since the smartphone will probably be in the pocket—it won’t be as easily accessible. The AI Pin addressed this better by being always accessible from the t-shirt or jacket where it is clipped. The Meta Ray-Ban was another good attempt, but since they are sunglasses, wearing them all the time is nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;software-design&quot;&gt;Software Design&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesse Lyu, the founder and CEO, begins his keynote by recognising one of the most fundamental issues with the way smartphones are designed. This is an extremely deep insight, and I’m so glad someone on such a large stage was able to express it. During the early days of the smartphone, Apple proudly used the line, “There’s an app for that,” in their marketing to highlight how many apps there were in the App Store. You see, in their view, there was an app that could achieve any task that you wanted to do. But the mental model of a person who wants to perform a specific task requires them to choose the app that would enable them to do it, then open that app and make the right choices in the interface in order to achieve the task. If you’ve got more than one app that could help you do that task, there’s some time spent in your mind deciding between them. And if you have a task that needs more than one app to be achieved, you’ve just made the choices even more complex. Given that most people have about 90 different apps on their phones on average, this isn’t a small matter. You also need to have downloaded these apps ahead of time in anticipation of needing them in the future. But that’s another story altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also third-generation thinking, where you have to consider the objective you need to achieve and then break it down into the steps required for the computer to help you achieve it. Contrast that with fourth-generation thinking, which simply requires the user to clearly express the goal, and the computer then breaks down the tasks into atomic bits, figures out the best tools to use to solve the problem, and solves it. This was science fiction before the advent of AI. This is reality today. There’s also the duplication of data and instructions between the apps to contend with. For example, travelling somewhere on a vacation requires an app for flight bookings, an app for hotel bookings, an app to book a ride, and another to research the highlights of the destination. Each of them will ask you for your name, dates, times, locations, your companions, your preferences, over and over again. And that’s not even considering the fact that you need to register with each app too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a problem today, and Jesse and his company used this idea as the foundation to build their solution to combat this problem. Kudos to them for being able to figure out a way around it with their Rabbit Hole interface, even though it doesn’t yet completely solve &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the problems. There’s much more to say about the software, the interfaces, and the UI design, which are all brilliant but table stakes for a game this big. The fact that they understood the above point and also broke through the 500ms (while not yet hitting the Doherty Threshold) makes the device feel really responsive, which is just amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;business-design&quot;&gt;Business Design&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the product was launched at $199 is simply a masterstroke. A device that purports to be an AI Companion is really only that useful today, and the price point is perfect. But how could they not have a recurring monthly fee? They must have servers running in the background to serve the needs of the users. How do they expect to fund this? To me, this is where the rabbit hole comes in. I think the apps need to pay to be listed there. Maybe not initially, but eventually. They also may have a local model running on the device that handles the majority of the daily queries and only passes along the complex ones to the server, à la &lt;a href=&quot;https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/&quot;&gt;Mixtral of Experts&lt;/a&gt;. This would keep their costs low too. There is a possibility that they will benefit from a model that understands the physical world of the user better. This is greenfield at the moment, and they are going to be one of the first to occupy this space. But this is me just conjecturing, and the answer may be far simpler; the operational costs may just be borne through VC funding until they hit some kind of threshold. Or maybe it has to do with advertising, a.k.a. “recommendations” that the agent provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The R1 is intriguing and addresses some key concerns of mobile computing. However, several challenges persist. While the Rabbit R1 excels in software, the hardware design falls short of being an effective AI companion. A smartwatch with a camera still remains the form factor to beat. Given these shortcomings, I predict limited usage and abandonment by most users within a few months unless these improvements are implemented by the time they start shipping in March. With regard to competition, this concept could easily be replicated by smartphone manufacturers. If they cannot produce it independently, an acquisition could be on the cards, which may be the anticipated endgame anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any AI companion, the major obstacle remains payments. The demo didn’t quite show how the many payments that were alluded to actually took place, and I’m curious to see how this aspect works. While I don’t personally wish to purchase this product due to the aforementioned issues and deficiencies, I still regard it as a ‘directional innovation’ that pushes the industry in the right direction. There will be numerous iterations before the ideal form factor for the product is realised, as well as the perfect business models for the companies backing them. Consequently, I intend to keep a close eye on Jesse and his team to see if they adapt and iterate as I anticipate they will.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Design review of the AI Pin by Humane</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a product designer, I analysed Humane’s first product, the AI Pin, and identified several critical challenges that need to be addressed. While the product’s primary purpose of replacing mobile phones is laudable, it faces significant obstacles. Firstly, the device needs to offer a 10X better value proposition than the mobile phone to convince users to switch. However, this proved difficult as the AI Pin struggled to deliver on this promise, particularly in terms of call and message functionality, social media, calendar management, navigation, photography, entertainment, running apps, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the voice-based input/output and low-resolution screen limit the device’s usefulness compared to a high-resolution touchscreen display. Additionally, the need for a tap activation can be slow and cumbersome, hindering the AI assistant’s utility. Demonstrations showed that the AI assistant takes time to retrieve information and respond, leading to frustration in daily usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/HumaneAIPin.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve the product, I would ask the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why create a phone replacement as the first version of the product? It would have been more effective to demonstrate the usefulness of an always-available AI assistant, as Meta RayBan did.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why use tap as a wake gesture when hot keywords or head turns towards the device could be faster and more hands-free?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What were the reasons for not pursuing a smartwatch with video capabilities? A watch offers familiar activation gestures like raising to wake, and provides a screen for information delivery and private touch inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many have criticised this project, upon closer examination, it appears that the product was rushed to market rather than be the example of the company’s vision. However, there is still hope for Humane as they continue to innovate. A truly effective always-available AI assistant has the potential to improve various aspects of life, and I await their future developments with interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to go into uncharted waters, and one must admire them for trying.&lt;/p&gt;
