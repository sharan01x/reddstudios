<h1>Glossary of Terms to Understand</h1>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Wallets</th>
<th>The software that allows you to interact with a blockchain and stores your private key to encrypt messages and public keys to decrypt them</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hardware Wallets</td>
<td>Software wallets that are running on independent devices and are considered more secure as they cannot be hacked remotely</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Private and Public Keys</td>
<td>A long set of hexadecimal numbers that can be used to cryptographically sign transactions. The Private Key is used to encode a message (or transaction) and the public key can be used to decrypt that message.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Coins</td>
<td>A unit of account on a blockchain that is usually used to pay for conducting operations on that chain. For example Bitcoin, Ethereum and Atom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tokens</td>
<td>It is a unit of account created for specific use that is based on the code of a different coin and therefore doesn’t have a blockchain of its own. For example Matic, DAI, UNI, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Alt Coins</td>
<td>Anything that’s not Bitcoin</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shit Coins</td>
<td>Any coin that doesn’t have good fundamentals and instead probably built to simply pump its value and dump it on the market. Doge coin is a prime example.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Metamask</td>
<td>A software wallet that is used as a browser plug-in</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HODL</td>
<td>Means Hold On for Dear Life. It is an investment strategy where people buy a coin and hold on to it for many years instead of selling it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WAGMI</td>
<td>“We Are Going to Make It” or “We All Gonna Make It”. A positive affirmation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BTFD</td>
<td>Buy The F*&amp;king Dip. An indication to buy a token or coin when the prices are low.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BUIDL</td>
<td>Build, spelt differently to indicate building in Web3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bear Market</td>
<td>When sentiments in the market are low</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bull Market</td>
<td>When sentiments in the markets are high and when new all-time-high’s are usually being hit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Layer 1 Chains</td>
<td>Blockchains that are the final settlement layers and provide their own security</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Layer 2 Chains</td>
<td>Blockchains built on top of L1 chains that usually do not perform their own security or finality and are instead built to handle fast and cheap transactions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>App Chains</td>
<td>Application specific blockchains as opposed to general purpose blockchains</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DEX</td>
<td>Decentralised Exchanges. They are typically exchanges where one coin or token can be changed for another coin or token. They usually do not have any KYC requirements. For example UniSwap, SushiSwap, DYDX.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CEX</td>
<td>Centralised Exchanges where the same operations as DEX’s can take place. They usually have KYC requirements and make it simpler for new users.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stable Coins</td>
<td>Any coin whose value is pegged to a US dollar or any other Fiat currency. They have properties of tokens so that they can be used in crypto transactions (as Fiat currencies can’t be used in this way). But their value is based on the real-world value of the Fiat currency it represents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DeFi</td>
<td>Decentralised Finance. It represents an industry within crypto that is trying to build equivalent infrastructures that are present in traditional finance institutions like banks. They enable people to deposit their currencies and earn interest, lend their money to others, borrow money from others, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cefi, TradFi</td>
<td>The slang for centralised finance or traditional finance</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Staking</td>
<td>The act of securing a Proof of Stake network by depositing coins into staking pools</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delegation</td>
<td>If the amount of a coin or token you have is low and you can’t meet the minimum requirements of staking, you can delegate your tokens to someone else and they will then stake your tokens once they have the required number of tokens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Liquidity Pools</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Automatic Market Makers</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Merge</td>
<td>This is the point where the Ethereum blockchain switched its consensus mechanism from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. It was a major milestone and therefore got a name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ERC20</td>
<td>A coding standard for tokens that are built on the Ethereum blockchain. Examples of this include ETH, OP, ARB and others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ERC 721</td>
<td>A coding standard for NFT’s that are built on the Ethereum blockchain. This is usually used when you have only one copy of an NFT, called “1 of 1”. Usually used to represent ownership of expensive objects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ERC 1155</td>
<td>A coding standard for NFT’s that are built on the Ethereum blockchain. It is usually used when multiple copies of an NFT are produced by the creator.</td>
</tr>
