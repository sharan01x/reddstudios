                <h2>Building Move 37</h2>
<p>As a bit of background, I built <a href="https://move37.works/">Move 37</a>, an application that is a reimagining of word processors like Word or Pages, to better suit today's media landscape. We have several forms of content, everything from blogs and social media posts to podcasts and videos, and it is possible to communicate a single idea in all these forms with a few tweaks to the core content. Like the leaps that were made possible when the word processing applications were shipped on computers, with Move 37, a single individual today could become a media publishing house that served content in the form that their consumers wanted it. On demand. </p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this is exactly the sort of thing that artificial intelligence (AI), specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) are well suited for. </p>
<p><img alt="Move37Screenshot.png" src="bd45aaa3_24f6fb13e8c4448dbceb5889b68c7690.png" /></p>
<p>Being a digital product designer, it was impossible for me to not observe the various ways in which AI could be employed within the application and the effects that each choice would have. If I employ AI well, it becomes and extremely useful tool that saves an incredible amount of time and effort. If I employ it badly, I could create AI slop generation engine. Or the worst crime of all, I could kill the user's agency where they don't use their own judgement anymore and end up becoming button-pushing-monkeys in the long run. </p>
<p>My deep realisation was that there was a very fine line between these two choices and it was important to pay attention not only to the places where AI should be employed, but more importantly, where not to use it. </p>
<p>This article is a way for me to log my learnings, as it were. But if you are someone infusing AI capabilities into your application, I hope all the time and effort spent in learning these lessons give you a leg up in your endeavour.</p>
<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
<p>Before I began, I wanted to understand what AI is and isn't capable of within the context of my application. As I saw it, it's strengths are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI is multimodal and can produce text, images, audio and video -- exactly what I need</li>
<li>Since they are Language Models, they are very good at languages and a perfect fit not only for spelling and grammar checks, but also for translations across languages.</li>
<li>AI has a vast knowledge base and can find and check facts very simply and that makes it very suited to being a writing aid</li>
<li>Unlike programs that can recognise text or images, AI can understand the ideas discussed in the text or images and this is useful in comparing various pieces of knowledge, especially when the same idea has been expressed in multiple ways</li>
<li>AI can be used in 'fuzzy situations' where you are not working with exact information and this makes it extremely suitable for searching knowledge bases or for creative applications, like in creating illustrations</li>
</ul>
<p>And, it's weaknesses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It really doesn't know when it makes a mistake. It is always confident in what it says. This quality makes AI a liability in many situations. </li>
<li>The same input doesn't produce the same output. This makes programs more suitable when exact outputs are required from exact inputs.</li>
<li>It can be extremely slow if employed in performing basic operations. </li>
<li>Don't rely on AI for calculations. While this is likely to change very quickly, LLMs aren't flawless at mathematics as yet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Things to Consider</h2>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>My first thought was about privacy. Granted that the application I was building was meant for publishing, but still, I wanted to build this on a strong foundation of privacy. I didn't want any aspect of the data from the application going to centralised AI models if I could help it. </p>
<p><img alt="OpenSourceModels.png" src="bd45aaa3_520f932aea984933827ce657c27f9e91.png" /></p>
<p>The reason for it is quite simple, these centralised models like the ones from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others are very capable. But since the data going to them are going to be collected and mined, I didn't want any user data to end up in that pile. While no one expects these companies to use the data against their users, one must never give rise to such a possibility. </p>
<p>So if you must use AI, try to use something locally hosted. If that is not a possibility, try to use open source models from a number of different models and service providers as in Move 37's case. </p>
<p>But to be clear, Move 37 does have the frontier models present as an option of last resort so that the user is always able to perform their actions. But in all the usage so far, we've never had to use this option.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>AI can do a lot of things and the temptation to use it in many situations is always present. But keep in mind that even with home automation being all the rage, we still haven't been able to get rid of physical light switches from our homes. Would you be asking Alexa or Google to turn on the light switch if you were standing in front of it? The analogy exists in the application world as well. Sometimes it is just faster to use a program to do a job than to employ AI to do it. </p>
<p>For example, Move 37 is capable of taking social media messages and posting them for you. Now, I could have built in methods to instruct AI to go to LinkedIn and post the message for the user, but this would take a very long time to perform as the AI needs to take screenshots of your computer at every step, send it to the server, analyse it, plan the next steps and then do it on the user's computer. This was the case on <em>every</em> run. But since LinkedIn's website wasn't changing everyday, this level of analysis being performed on every run was not only slow and inefficient, it was also quite expensive. This was much more easily handled by taking a scripted approach where the application would look for this element first, perform this action next, etc. This was incredibly fast and also performed with absolutely no use of AI.</p>
<p>It's best to always begin with asking whether you need to employ AI for the task.</p>
<h3>Accuracy</h3>
<p>I already spoke about not using AI to do mathematics, but it is also important to keep in mind that the output from the models cannot be tightly controlled either. Expecting output accuracy from is a fool's errand. For example, there is a function in Move 37 where if you provide the text for a social media post, it is automatically converted into different lengths as they are required by different social media channels i. e. 280 characters for Twitter/X, 3000 for LinkedIn, etc. In my first attempt at doing this, I sent in all the accounts along with their limits to the AI and asked it to give me a structured JSON output with the text variations assigned to the specific accounts. </p>
<p><img alt="Variations.png" src="bd45aaa3_5f623f480eef4512810fc96a9ee524c3.png" /></p>
<p>This failed because the LLMs wouldn't always respect the different variants all the time. It did do it sometimes, and that lulls you into thinking that what you built will work in every case, but that's just not true. The solution to this was to have the AI create the text variations and get that sent to a function that would count the characters and assign it reliably to the right accounts.</p>
<h3>Affordances</h3>
<p>But that's not all. Every output can also vary. As in the previous example, I had instructed the AI to provide a JSON output and even provided the example in my prompt. But the output, while JSON, had different formatting. Sometimes it included the outermost braces and sometimes it didn't. You'd always have to write functions that would normalise these outputs and use it correctly.</p>
<p>A less technical example may be that you ask the AI to count the number of items in a list. The output can be "5", "five" or even "There were 5 items", "I counted 5 items". If you needed to use this output in the application's interface, you would first need to think about these possibilities and try to include instructions in your. prompt regarding the output and format that you need. If you need to use the output within the interface, it would also be good for you to consider these possibilities and build affordances within your interface to be able to handle these possibilities.</p>
<p>Not only that, every model behaves a little differently. Even within specific models, newer versions of the same model will handle scenarios differently. So keeping all these aspects in mind when building your program would be a good idea. Otherwise you run the risk of making your application very brittle.</p>
<h3>Creativity</h3>
<p>I'd argue that this is one of the best use cases for AI. If there's any space within your application where you need a creative take on things, using AI there would probably be a good idea. But be careful to use the output from the AI only as fodder for the creative endeavour and not the output itself.</p>
<p>In Move 37, I built a podcast module that would take the text of the article and create a podcast script from it and also produce the audio version of it automatically. The entire task took about 5 to 10 minutes. I thought this was a great use for AI, but I quickly realised that this would take away from the value of the podcast because the human had no role to play in it. That approach sometimes resulted in shallow coverage of the depth of an article that the user wrote. In other words, it created AI slop.</p>
<p><img alt="Podcasts.png" src="bd45aaa3_23b58e151fc64ba4b2d50e85a31c3dac.png" /></p>
<p>So I redesigned the module to first display the script of the podcast that was generated by the AI. This acted as a great starting point for the user and saved them an immense amount of time. The user could always start from scratch of course, but usually seeing a draft of something makes you think about how you could write it better, even if that meant re-writing the whole thing. And I think that's a great use of AI in the creative process.</p>
<h3>Taste</h3>
<p>As I've already illustrated in the points above, AI can be used in a lot of ways, but if we make the effort to position it as a tool, we'd be extracting real value from it and keeping our skills sharp, if not sharper. As I have faced several times myself, the temptation to make AI go "just one step further and complete the job" is exactly the line we must not cross. </p>
<p>One more important point I need to explicitly call out is to never put the AI in a place where it makes decisions for the user. There least important reason for this is that no one knows what data went into training the AI, not even those that trained the AI because the data sets are so large that no single human has ever verified all of it. This necessarily means that you can never be sure of the reasons behind the AI's decisions. </p>
<p>But I think the bigger point is that doing so slowly chips away a very important quality from the user, which is taste. We develop our sense of taste by making a vast number of decisions and seeing whether the outcomes matches the vision of the world we want to see created. This is a core human quality. It is what drives us to bend and shape the world around us. This is something that should never be outsourced to anyone. Because, in the future neither effort nor skills are going to be barriers for us to do something. In such a world, the only thing that matters is taste.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There was a time when websites with SSL protection indicated it through a lock icon placed in the address bar. Today, it's the opposite where websites with SSL protection is the default and you're warned when you access a site without that protection. In the same way, we're headed into a world where AI will be the default engine that performs most actions within an application. But until then, it would be a good idea to communicate which parts of your app are using AI so that users take the precaution they need when using that function within the app. </p>

<p>Paragraph, the blog publication platform does this really nicely where it indicates the use of AI clearly within their interface. I am yet to do this consistently for Move 37, but I thought I'd still mention it since this was important. </p>
